			<p>I&rsquo;ve been away.  I&rsquo;ll tell you why.  I was feeling crushed by the crush of the self-crush.  Learning the full stack had become the beast that I could never feed enough &ndash; not enough energy, study, effort, time, weekends, or nights &ndash; the beast had become a burden.  Advice of the head is hard to seep in the heart somehow, the membrane is pro- or anti- lipids I can&rsquo;t remember which one.  I realized the importance of not grinding your wheels and rails to a pulp &ndash; even choo-choos have limits &ndash; yet, there I was gunning like some 16-yr old rodeo bullrider with everything to prove and nothing to lose, all burn all the time.</p>

<p>I got 4 days away &ndash; I was determined to work during those 4 days, but as soon as I entered back into the lazy obese air of my place of birth, sitting in the oppressive quiet of my mother&rsquo;s house, backbone.js was gone.  Backbone.js couldn&rsquo;t be further away &ndash; iterm and sublime had no place in my plane of reality anymore.  It was just a few days, but I feel more grounded and grasping of a perspective on everything that is going on again.  Paradigm shifts are a must.  Rest is a must.</p>

<p>Here are some bullet points organized in no particular theme, purpose, nor order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>about 2 weeks ago, Emily from MongoDB came to speak to us, and for the first time in my life I felt aroused about a database</p></li>
<li><p>my endurance has increased &ndash; I can now google search about something I know nothing about over and over for longer periods of time with less cop-out</p></li>
<li><p>I work better with earplugs in and music on</p></li>
<li><p>New York Times Hackathon this weekend !</p></li>
<li><p>I like capstone-project phase and the analog Trello system we got going in the classroom on a plane of glass.  Lewis and Clark up in the digital sphere with only the occasional courier dispatch.</p></li>
<li><p>Going home at 9pm no matter if I&rsquo;m feeling energetic or not is a life-saver must law</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s all gonna get done &ndash; it just will.  No matter how many hours you put in or kill/sacrifice yourself for the work &ndash; it&rsquo;ll get done somehow.  Often in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.  A friend wiser than me who&rsquo;s lived through it told me.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding remains a subclass that inherits from the class of life.  Never forget it.</p></li>
<li><p>Charlotte yoga is a lifesaver.  Can she do Rails tutorials in her soothing voice?  Breathe in through the nostrils, Movies has_many Actors.  Now breathe out through the mouth &ndash; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh h h</p></li>
<li><p>4 weeks left.  Let&rsquo;s have some f*cking fun.</p></li>
</ul>

			<p>I am excited that we are nearing the end of the stack.  There&rsquo;s lots of things I would love to have time to go back and work on.  I feel like I got the &ldquo;Europe in 3 days!&rdquo; tour.  I wanna go back, get lost on some old cobbled backstreets, chill out for an hour at a cafe, and really understand why French people get so uppity when you speak to them in English.</p>

<p>I am more and more convinced that hacking is definitely a DO-type endeavor.  Tomorrow I will begin to work on implementing a site that can link up various video screens, so people can play music together, attend a concert, a talk, or other social event.  I&rsquo;m werking to twerk the angles to see how it can be more of a social experiment &ndash; a platform free for the people to use and experiment with.  Teach me a thing or three, please.  I am imagining like your own Ticketmaster, your own Madison Square Garden.  A virtual concert hall/theatre/lecture space for selling tickets to whatever you can, whatever your followers love for you to share.  First things first though, just to get 3 screens to show up, and be able to throw that into a room.  Tiny step.  Long journey.</p>

<p>Front-end vs. back-end:  Front-end is exciting.  Back-end is necessary &ndash; it&rsquo;s solid, got fortitude, but no one notices the trunk of trees (unless there&rsquo;s a problem).  People drive upstate to watch leaves change though.  I am interested in getting more into UI/UX.</p>

<!-- The backbone.js presentation yesterday was blowing way over my head.

I'm pissed at Ajax right now.

The amalgamation of rails/activerecord/sql/ruby/mvc <=> erb/html <=> jQuery/ajax/javascript all on one page with all their objects and &#8220;.&#8220;&#8216;s kinda ravages my brain.  Can javascript pointers point to ruby objects that point to sql objects, or are javascript and ruby/rails object pointers more like two rivers that never intersect?  Or, do they intersect through the sql database? &#8211;>

			<p>Michael Nutt, co-founder and CTO of Moveable Ink (<a href="https://moveableink.com">https://moveableink.com</a>) rolled through to drop some knowledge and experience tonight for Fullstack talk/dinner.  He came up with the idea for Moveable Ink on a Friday, coded a rough through the weekend, worked with no revenue for a year, but it took off and it&rsquo;s been going places ever since.  Also, Michael beat out 400 developers in the Hacking Education contest which encourages the public to make discoveries and build apps to improve education in America.  Pretty cool stuff.  Then Stephen Colbert awarded him the most American-y trophy ever, and he got to sit in the chair and the set of the Colbert Report (<a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/blog/2011/07/25/stephen-colbert-anoints-big-winner/">http://www.donorschoose.org/blog/2011/07/25/stephen-colbert-anoints-big-winner/</a>).</p>

<p>Michael was the guy who came over and helped us get our lego robot to work that fateful first Fullstack Friday eons ago &ndash; I had no idea he was such a start-up kingpin, tech and dev wizard &ndash; he&rsquo;s the nicest, most approachable guy.  Not to say talented, hard-working, and successful people are assholes &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t know he had so many other important things to be doing instead of playing legos!</p>

<p>Today he spoke to us about scaling your business once it begins to take off, giving us insights on the app and database side of things.  It was a bit over my head, but really nice to hear.  Afterwards, a fellow student seemed a bit bewildered as well and felt lost.</p>

<p>I got these thoughts right then though, that one day we would be there.  Like, it&rsquo;s overwhelming now, because we&rsquo;re still trying to work out the basics, and they&rsquo;re talking high-level strategy.  You can&rsquo;t weave the defense, spin and glide, before you get your dribble down.  But once you got it like second nature, then you can focus on court vision, creativity, jerk and flow like a painting.  And, once you got that down, you can practice true inter-dependence and lead a team of 11 to victory.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get there, I told him.  We&rsquo;ll get there.  It might not be on our plate right now, but it&rsquo;s on the table.  It&rsquo;s on the spread.  We&rsquo;ll get there.  Bring on the stories, the glory, the pain, the losses, the wins.  I like feeling like I can be in the game.  I like knowing I can be there.  Call my name so I may turn my head and see what tasty-goodness is available.  Point it out so I may smell it, dream, plot, werk and twerk.  Put notice on, so I may figure out how to get it on my plate because I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

			<p>The ebb and flow of intense emotions and experiences takes me up and leaves me at sea.  The sight of land is a luxury no one can expect &ndash; the rising and setting sun will simply have to do.  My friend, they talk about connecting the dots only in hindsight.  It&rsquo;ll all make sense then, like some tiny islands, when you hop lead you to the main piece, the big show, the motherland.  They talk about fumbling forth, fingers grasp fistfuls of darkness.  They, talk about many things.  When you live, the voices have nowhere to go, or maybe they are close, but your ears cannot process them as the wind rushes by and through your body, a just cracked window in a car makes an epic soundtrack &ndash; living a bit reckless is better than thinking cautious riding pine &ndash; at least I say.  And through it all, through this all, that&rsquo;s what I still say.  Bold.  I know.  Self-assured.  Cocksure.  Sure.  I feel young, and all things possible.  The grim and the grime of lesser times cannot hold on much longer.  It just can&rsquo;t.  And then on and on, it&rsquo;ll go.  To the next adventure lined up to see.</p>

<p>Today, was great.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people are scared to say shit is great.  They fear that maybe, it actually doesn&rsquo;t qualify as great.  Perhaps people around them will think they have shit standards, because what they proclaimed publicly as GREAT, was actually SHIT.  They cast doubt to say so also because, maybe, they think, the amounts of greats we have is limited, and if you keep having GREATs, then all the shit days leftover will come tumbling down and crush your spine, making you a paralyzed shitty cyborg living a life that&rsquo;s worse than death itself, that&rsquo;s why you always say shit is mediocre!  Just alright.  At best, meh!  Although, secretly inside, it was kinda really fucking good man, and you know it.  Shhh, don&rsquo;t let the fates know, or else they&rsquo;ll start distributing strife to balance the scales!  This is not the justice we seek.  Let the fates do what it do.  Your job is to be great, to experience as many great moments as you possibly can, to feel great as much as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Today, I was treated to a tour of WeWork offices today, dynamic, electric, packed with dream-chasers, start-ups, boutique operations, artists, fashionistas, free beer, free arcades, lots of glass with marker scribble, 30th floor New York views, and conference call phone booths.  Then, I had fish friday (king fish at Veronica&rsquo;s Kitchen food truck (the red sannnper is better)).  Then, I came back, figured out some last minute code to link the cart in our kickstarter project, got it to work, presented our site to the class, then the rest of the day was art class (a visual and conceptual primer before we dive into HTML/CSS next week).  I&rsquo;ve never painted on canvas before but it was therapeutic, fun, expressive, and reminded me of why since long ago I chased and fantasized about that crazy artist life so hard and never ever fully let go.  After, a few of us Fullstackers walked to Chinatown and ate soup dumplings at this place my cousin recommended (Shanghai Cafe).  It was good, and I caught the train, somehow found the way home, and Rob at school found my iphone (cause I left it at Fullstack).  Tomorrow is the weekend, an opportunity to continue working on our kickstarter project (cause our group is having so much fun we still on it like Voltron), or my own personal project, or the Rails Rumble project, and there&rsquo;s a hackathon to attend, and I will meditate, and do laundry, eat a great lunch, and do everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do ever if I only had time, until the realization that it is 4pm on Sunday sets in &ndash; the weekend is over &ndash; and I become slightly sad at all the things I now &ldquo;have to do&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;want to do,&rdquo; then get over it, wonder where another week of my life went, then eventually freak out at how awesome and possible everything that ever existed ever was again because it&rsquo;s now next Friday afternoon/evening (aka Golden Hour).  Then again.  And again.  and Again.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still great though.</p>

			<p>Rails is making more sense (and losing its magic).  I am getting the sense (sixth) more &ndash; to know where to dig &ndash; controller, model, views, routes.  Working through this project, I feel I got a better grasp of what the controller and the model does and how to divide &ldquo;za bizness&rdquo; between the two.  I got a better idea of how the associations work and how to worm through those associations and methods to find the exact value you are looking for.  I would like to practice more model associations/method accessing in the future to really solidify the feel.</p>

<p>Working in a team of 4 this time was fun and a dream.  We used Trello as our hub strategy (strategery), and we&rsquo;d break, go off into the wilderness, forage for working code (delicious code mushrooms), come back, share our discoveries, then push (git push) the project forward.  I know it won&rsquo;t always be this easy, maybe we just hit a good flow this time, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that it can.  In the beginning, I personally felt that we were trying to install too many features right off the get-go (especially after reading &lsquo;Getting Real&rsquo; all Sunday, I&rsquo;d become a devoted acolyte), but we eventually threw everything into the Trello product backlog and found a way as a group to focus first on the essentials.  It also helped that there was soooo much work to be done that we kinda knew we&rsquo;d just be chewing and chewing, and however much we bit through, was gonna just be that.  Being at a buffet with a stapled stomach takes the pressure off.  I like group work.</p>

			<p>What a difference some sleep makes.  I&rsquo;m finally caught up on rest after the weekend.  It&rsquo;s Wednesday.  It&rsquo;s not even about having crazy weekends, it&rsquo;s about not working yourself to death(you&rsquo;ll always feel like you don&rsquo;t have enough time if you simply feel that way), then not blowing off steam recklessly (sleeping at 5am two nights in a row will really rock your sleep schedule).  It&rsquo;s about balance.  Knowing how to take time to pace and not work 14 days in a row (bad idea), then knowing how to go see friends but not stay out late to make up for working 14 days straight (bad idea + bad idea = just bad idea).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing this from various sources lately, and it&rsquo;s a good piece to keep around &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marathon, not a sprint.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s going to take time for new concepts, a brand new way of thinking, a brand new way of looking at the world, to truly sink in.  This is probably gonna change the way your brain puts everything together, so be patient.  If you do find yourself in a mad scram up a 90deg slope, just know, this is kinda what it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m progressing.  I&rsquo;m soaking it all up.  It&rsquo;s coming.  It&rsquo;s been a month really.  I&rsquo;m relearning America too (personal struggle).  Show up, show up, show up.  Show up, pace, keep fun, keep joy, and cruise.  Eye-of-the-storm.  Eezy peezy.</p>

<p>Today, we continued chopping up and rolling out like Navy Seals on this kickstarter project.  We scrum in Trello, then break, handle our parts, then git push, clear our commits, then group pull back down like we are sitting at some cotton spider-loom of interweb construction.  With guidance, we managed to install Stripe&rsquo;s credit-card payment API onto our page as checkout.  It&rsquo;s simple and barebones, but exciting.  Mostly because to test it, I keep paying myself lots of imaginary ducats and my customer count keeps climbing.  Soon I&rsquo;ll be rolling deep like 37signals and DHH, getting 10,000+ github commits, people flying me to talk about which Ruby gem is my favorite, which unicode symbol I prefer on my prompt during the Autumn Equinox, hipchatting honey-babies in my Bugatti, as I drip start-up ideas all over the place like a child discovering honey, money.</p>

<p>Man, it&rsquo;s a different world.</p>

			<p>Day 2 of kickstarter/crowdtilt.  We break chunks.  We scrum with the best of them.  We are the scrummiest.  Sometimes you non-stop win, other times you tear your sweater on a splinter &ndash; it&rsquo;s all good, you&rsquo;re still in the game.  Today, tackled and cleared up (to a certain extent) more under-hood Rails voodoo.  Associations are like untangling really thin and long earphone cables.  Patience, man, patience.  You wanna hear the music, don&rsquo;t you?  Did you know all about these things Rails is doing behind your back?  Creating 11 methods just because you said &lsquo;has_many&rsquo;?  Hey.  Surprise on me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s coming together, though.</p>

<p>Any progress is good progress.  And a whole bunch of other mantra type shit.  It&rsquo;s all true.</p>

<p>Until it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Our usual Fullstack Tuesday dinners was had yesterday when Andy, a freelance developer came by to share his vision of a trans-global life &ndash; free to work, free to be (which in his case is running marathons all over the world including Kenya and Alaska(?).  His current client wouldn&rsquo;t care if he was gone for 6mos on a beach in Thailand as long as his git pushes kept coming through and clean.  I&rsquo;m willing to stretch it to 1 or 2 yrs.  First, got to get the builder skills up though, wrestle some open source, get a few gems named after me and my body parts.</p>

<p>Late in the day, I invented an app that will aggregate people&rsquo;s grandmas and then farm them out to stranger&rsquo;s homes where they cook people really kickass home-meals for money.  Grandma Swap.  Or, maybe more like Grandma Pimp, huh.  Will the SPCA be mad at me?  I promise they&rsquo;re all free-range grandmas.  If anyone is interested in trusting me with your grandmas, let me know.  I&rsquo;m an old lady&rsquo;s dream.</p>

			<p>A third of the program is now in the bag.  In another 2 weeks, we will be shifting to pure projects.  It&rsquo;s kind of unbelievable.  However much I&rsquo;ve learned at this point, I&rsquo;m not even sure &ndash; I&rsquo;m just used to the struggle.  Today, we began constructing our own version of kickstarter/crowdtilt.  It&rsquo;s a meaty one for sure.  Working through it will only solidify the Rails understanding deeper.  Javascript will come soon as well, and then, the world.</p>
