			<p>A third of the program is now in the bag.  In another 2 weeks, we will be shifting to pure projects.  It&rsquo;s kind of unbelievable.  However much I&rsquo;ve learned at this point, I&rsquo;m not even sure &ndash; I&rsquo;m just used to the struggle.  Today, we began constructing our own version of kickstarter/crowdtilt.  It&rsquo;s a meaty one for sure.  Working through it will only solidify the Rails understanding deeper.  Javascript will come soon as well, and then, the world.</p>

			<p>I&rsquo;m excited about things.  Ideas, progress.  I finally cracked through a RSpec till all green completion alllmmost by myself earlier today.  Triumph.  Rails is becoming more sensible.  We have an evaluation tomorrow.  Too tired, can&rsquo;t read my many furious notes.  Study in the morning.  Also, note to self, no more 7-day continuous study/work weeks &ndash; Sunday must be an off-day.  Okay, friend.  Also, must eat lunch every day &ndash; skimming by on cereal is no bueno.  Check.  Got some inspirato from fellow classmate/comrade regarding project today.  Gonna run it by the pros (Dave &amp; Nim), flesh out more, and maybe it be hackable.  Exciting.  Reading book on start-up culture over weekend.  Looking forward to it.  Earlier today, we had a code-typing-speed relay competition.  Spice it up.  Macbook chicklet keys usually low-pro and smooth to touch, but not as fancy when your fingers shaking from nerves.  Werd.</p>

			<p>Cat claws be latching my jeans, like Rails latch me brain.  We worked on putting the StackWorld website room warp project onto pure Rails today, and it was a good chance to wrap our heads around the whole structure, MCV, behind-the-scenes voodoo, all that jazz.  I had my sleep and ate more of my bagel than I usually do, had toooo many cups of green tea, was amped, and driving, driven, and droven.  Head down, forking and porking, it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it was doable.  Definitely doable.  It&rsquo;s always the little hiccups that get you.  Misspellings, effing misspellings.  Am I misspelling mispelings now? oh soh me-tta.  Mis-spellings will mess you up man.  And this whole Rails-so-smart-it-know-plurals! mess, will also mess you up.  Remember &ndash; models => singular.  Controller => plural.  This saves trouble, keeps nosebleed blood inside brain.  Tomorrow is coming.  Tomorrow will come soon.  I must sleep.</p>

			<p>After a weekend, that didn&rsquo;t feel much like a weekend because it was spent catching up on pre-work and learning about Rails, Monday rolled on forth with more Rails.  I was kinda glad I stayed in and brushed up, and by brushed up, I mean learned for the first time, Rails, because we dove right into it today.  Sinatra &ndash; out.  Rails in.  Rails is crazy cause with 2 command line returns, there&rsquo;s this mass of folders and controllers, routes, models, html/css that&rsquo;s just blegghgh right there.  Kinda like how this morning I awoke to my friend&rsquo;s cat wailing and making caulking-gun sounds.  I open the door, and there it was.  All this vomit everywhere.  Hello, Ruby on Rails generate scaffold function!</p>

<p>Still working out the kinks, the connections, and my feelings towards this whole framework.  I went to a childhood friend&rsquo;s place for dinner and he asked me, so what does Rails do when you build a website?  Good question.  I just told him it&rsquo;s like some sort of glue that seeps in and makes things easier between html and SQL, and everything&hellip; um, yeah.  That&rsquo;s Rails!  Get&rsquo;s all up in there, you know?  Kinda like that cat vomit is all up inbetween the wood planks.  That&rsquo;s part of the house now.</p>

<p>Oh man, Rails, what have they been feeding you?</p>

		<time>05 October 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>I wish I had some great metaphor or anecdote that would move you right here, crumble the mountains and shake the shores, but I don&rsquo;t.  I just got reality in my pockets, and life in my veins.  And, it&rsquo;s gonna have to be enough.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>This is informed both by the current state of affairs in code-land, but also by my own personal affairs back home.  The bridge isn&rsquo;t hard to forge.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Friday, we worked on crawlers to gank links off our Stackworld pages from the day before.  Gank, recursive; self-replicating viruses of gankdom.</p>

<p>Saturday, I&rsquo;m here again, but I&rsquo;m not really here.  I&rsquo;m giving it all I got in time, energy, and mind, but other things got my heart.  And, I think that&rsquo;s okay.  Not everything&rsquo;s a straight-line, even in immersive 3month programs.  Goals, achievements, careers, fancy/expensive pieces of paper, jobs, all these little applications, still need to be made available by the server of health, love, and life.  I&rsquo;m especially reminded of that today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a drawing I made trying to understand things:</p>

			<p>With the coming autumn/winter season, people are flipping out about colds/viruses/flus and the such, hand-sanitizer companies are padding their expense accounts in hand-sanitizer company-like ways like a company scavenger hunt in a landfill followed by a company picnic.  Free hand-sanitizer for all involved including family/friends, of course!  In my mind, companies and employees of said companies all joyously and single-mindedly pursue the seamless integration of their product into their lives &ndash; hence a hand-sanitizer company employee just CAN&rsquo;T WAIT to test the extent of hand-sanitizer power in their lives and really stick it to those germs!  Following this example, I will save my exposition on the valor and robustness of condom-company employees for another day when morale is truly low.  You simply won&rsquo;t believe what a couple hundredths of a millimeter of latex will embolden an otherwise sane human being to attempt.  For the company!</p>

<p>Sickness, illness, colds.  I see at them as life&rsquo;s breaks.  If your body can&rsquo;t fight off a common cold, it&rsquo;s probably because you are overextended.  We all work so hard, sometimes something outside of ourselves mercifully taps us on the shoulder, and puts the brakes on for us.  Colds, even the flu, they are more opportunities for rest than outside invaders that must be defeated.  The body is strong and knows what to do.  Trust it.  Rest it.</p>

<p>Today, started off as another high-aspiration day as we do at Fullstack Academy, but for some reason we caught a cold.  Well, the campus did &ndash; the internet went out.  For a tech house, wifi is the air in your nostrils.  Time to blow the nose, sip some soda, watch TV and sleep &ndash; we took it easy today.  I think once all of our internal meth-rock-chewing slave-drivers surrendered to the idea that we were not getting anything done until the internet was back on, we were able to let go of the pace; some of us even left the building, went outside, took a stroll, overlooked the water, stared off into nothing, lied down on the boardwalk.</p>

<p>Of course, it was easy to figure exactly when the internet was back on &ndash; silence, heads returned downward at a slight 78degrees &ndash; plugged in, dropped out &ndash; back in the machine.</p>

<p>We still managed to cover Ruby regular expressions, and discuss web crawling.  Tomorrow we construct scrapers, I am excited about these little script-robots we&rsquo;ll be getting a handle on.  The read-ups sound ever-so slightly suspect though &ndash; this is where hackers(as in trying to make code work) and hackers(as in breaking into code that&rsquo;s not theirs) begin to get some bridges.  I like it.</p>

			<p>The Active Record/Sinatra/SQLite collabo.. wait, did we start it yesterday or fresh today?  Who knows anymore.  I just had to check my own blog, to write my own blog.  Head in a fog, log, bog, smog, brog.  Today was fun.  We made weird worlds, and I put chips and salsa everywhere, and David put guac, and Nimit hi-jacked my macbook like a Somali pirate and I&rsquo;m that new Tom Hanks movie where it&rsquo;s stressful and he grows a beard and keeps order over his seamen.  Surely persistence and the drive to discover is how you learn (so that&rsquo;s how you get good at things!).</p>

<p>Week 3 of the program, rolling along &ndash; thinking that we are already 25% of the way through the course, puts the fear in me like a lake of fire/gnashing of teeth next to the devil could never instill.  YOU ARE ALREADY &frac14; OF THE WAY THROUGH WITH YOUR WEB DEV IMMERSIVE SOON YOU WILL TAKE THE SKILLS YOU HAVE ACQUIRED FIND A JOB AND START WORKING WITH SAID SKILLS ON THE DAILY FOR MONEY.  This statement, is so fucking scary, it could be used in your favor to convert me to any religion/religions/causes/cults/sex-cults/porno-cage-dungeons of your heart&rsquo;s desire.  Yes, I will do porn if you just keep yelling that sentence at me.  I&rsquo;m so scared, yes, I&rsquo;m ready to shoot!!</p>

<p>In less scary news, or actually, rather debatable, check out what I made at school today mama!</p>

<p><a href="https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new">https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new</a></p>

<p>Come on in, have some chips n salsa in the foyer, kick up a shoe or two, pee in my double golden toilets (made of real gold, not that plated stuff), take a bounce or three in my double moon bounces, and check out some real meat in the dry-age-room/muscle dungeon.  But only if you dare.  Don&rsquo;t eat spaghetti squash in front of your keyboard while you explore these wormholes either, soldier.  Also, go ahead, put in your name (I&rsquo;ll never see it), create some rooms and add items to your heart&rsquo;s content (I will see these), and make some connections between those rooms to keep Wenson Stack World spicier than a mala pepper gone down the wrong throat path.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy.  Here, to help things along, I&rsquo;ll tell/show you about myself.</p>

			<p>Today, we had our 3rd Fullstack Dinner, and it was pizza.  Grandma&rsquo;s pizza, Grandpa&rsquo;s pizza, White pizza, mushroom pizza (which no one touched inexplicably) &ndash; the pizza game be diversified.  The day was one with a good flow &ndash; we first learned about the internets.  The internets is busy, and it keeps passing stuff back and forth like basketball drills to keep us seeing things and un-revolty.  The US government was down today (effing ridiculous), but hey, it&rsquo;s fine when you can watch people do things on Brobible.com (mind sanitize).</p>

<p>Then we moved on to designing this multi-room portal site pulling in Sinatra, Rails(Active Record), SQL, and HTML/CSS which was pretty cool, cause it lets people come onto your site, and then create a room and name things.  Of course, the first room I named was the toilet, because every good space including a wormhole, needs a toilet (keep it hyperspace-clean, son!).  My butt cheeks be allergic to anything that&rsquo;s not gold even when I&rsquo;m space-dimensional-contiuum-irrespective-morphing/traveling.</p>

<p>I went back in time to fetch a 24k gold spouted butt-washer add-on with adjustable pressure/temperature controls.  Worth the risk of having to fight dinosaurs/aliens/zombies.</p>

			<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a toss, between life and the immersive.  No one said it would be easy.  No one said this.  And, certainly, no one promised that weekends would be rejuvenating.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s work was comprehendable enough.  We got to know the mystical black magic that is Active Record (AR) in Ruby on Rails.  It speaks a sort of yoda backwards SQL, and it does a bunch of weird things behind your back (well, not super weird, but certainly AR has a bit of the flair for the theatrical), oh, and did I mention, sir/madaam AR cares about your use of singles vs plural, even when it&rsquo;s only referencing your class objects as such for its own entertainment?  To not do so, would be uncivilized.</p>

<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m coming apart on a munday funday.  The week is a young-day.  Better keep strong.  Today, my pair-partner came down with a sickness, and now family-sized dispensers of Purell are on every desk in the house.  Keep the energy up, keep the health meters up, the mana and the mojo.  Rest, all you have to do is rest, and it&rsquo;ll be all right.</p>
