			<p>The New York Times Hackathon was a great experience.  I&rsquo;m super glad I went.  Just 2 days prior, I was about to not go, but David posed the question &ndash; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your excuse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Err, I don&rsquo;t have a team,&rdquo; I replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off to work &ndash; I committed myself to figuring out an idea before lunchtime that day.  After flipping through the sponsor API&rsquo;s, I hit on something fun.  What if we could use the NY Public Library&rsquo;s (sponsor) <a href="http://menus.nypl.org/">Menu API</a> with another API to find places to eat obscure dishes from the 1800&rsquo;s?  Fortunately, this was received well by other students looking to participate, and there you go, I had a team.</p>

<p>The morning of, me and <a href="http://hjbuchanan.github.io/">Hanj</a> were the first people there.  After getting in, then averting a near catastrophe (a team-member forgot his laptop at a bar the night before, possibly losing his entire capstone project), Rob, Eric, Jules, and I got to work on putting together the Menu app.  As per discussions the night before, Jules (veteran hackathon champ) recommended we simply use d3 to graph out the most popular items over decades (we were doing this compromise because there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough time for my original idea I assumed).</p>

<p>A strange thing happend around 3pm, just 5 hours before we were to decide whether we would demo or not.  We found that Jules&#8217; idea to data visualize was already a feature on the NYPL Menu site, AND it looked good hahaha.  Again I suggested we try my original idea.  It was at this point that both Jules and Hanj admitted, they didn&rsquo;t realize that was what I was going for, and that having an app to find places to eat popular dishes from the 1800&rsquo;s is &lsquo;an even better more fun idea!&rsquo;  To quote from fellow student/fashion hawk <a href="http://istevenson.github.io/">Imon</a> &ndash; &ldquo;Well, DUHHHHHHHHH HH H.. .&rdquo;  Where these cats been??</p>

<p>Just like that, we reorganized and went back into our rabbit holes.  Around 7pm, Rob had figured out timeline.js, and my map functionalities came in for a landing in Eric&rsquo;s frontend and Jules&#8217; backend.</p>

<p>Then we presented.  And we watched other people present.  Our fellow Fullstackers (we ended having 3 separate teams) took the People&rsquo;s Choice Award with their &ldquo;Right-wingify the NY Times&rdquo; hack, that got people in the crowd so worked up I saw people crying from laughter.</p>

<p>That Brookyln Lager around 10pm never tasted so good.</p>

<p>Lessons learned:  Being my first hackathon experience, I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, but observing, participating, and achieving goals, I felt that all the projects that day were within our capabilities.  In fact, if I may say so (and I realize this is me saying so about our own project), our Menu app was within the top 87th percentile of interesting works.  And, that was with burning half the day just trying to find our direction!</p>

<p>All in all, I recommend if you have a chance, to attend hackathons, generate ideas, see them come to life, meet some people, eat some food, and most importantly, get a handle on some swaggggg</p>
