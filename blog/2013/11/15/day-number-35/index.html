			<p>I&rsquo;ve been away.  I&rsquo;ll tell you why.  I was feeling crushed by the crush of the self-crush.  Learning the full stack had become the beast that I could never feed enough &ndash; not enough energy, study, effort, time, weekends, or nights &ndash; the beast had become a burden.  Advice of the head is hard to seep in the heart somehow, the membrane is pro- or anti- lipids I can&rsquo;t remember which one.  I realized the importance of not grinding your wheels and rails to a pulp &ndash; even choo-choos have limits &ndash; yet, there I was gunning like some 16-yr old rodeo bullrider with everything to prove and nothing to lose, all burn all the time.</p>

<p>I got 4 days away &ndash; I was determined to work during those 4 days, but as soon as I entered back into the lazy obese air of my place of birth, sitting in the oppressive quiet of my mother&rsquo;s house, backbone.js was gone.  Backbone.js couldn&rsquo;t be further away &ndash; iterm and sublime had no place in my plane of reality anymore.  It was just a few days, but I feel more grounded and grasping of a perspective on everything that is going on again.  Paradigm shifts are a must.  Rest is a must.</p>

<p>Here are some bullet points organized in no particular theme, purpose, nor order:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>about 2 weeks ago, Emily from MongoDB came to speak to us, and for the first time in my life I felt aroused about a database</p></li>
<li><p>my endurance has increased &ndash; I can now google search about something I know nothing about over and over for longer periods of time with less cop-out</p></li>
<li><p>I work better with earplugs in and music on</p></li>
<li><p>New York Times Hackathon this weekend !</p></li>
<li><p>I like capstone-project phase and the analog Trello system we got going in the classroom on a plane of glass.  Lewis and Clark up in the digital sphere with only the occasional courier dispatch.</p></li>
<li><p>Going home at 9pm no matter if I&rsquo;m feeling energetic or not is a life-saver must law</p></li>
<li><p>It&rsquo;s all gonna get done &ndash; it just will.  No matter how many hours you put in or kill/sacrifice yourself for the work &ndash; it&rsquo;ll get done somehow.  Often in the end, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter.  A friend wiser than me who&rsquo;s lived through it told me.</p></li>
<li><p>Coding remains a subclass that inherits from the class of life.  Never forget it.</p></li>
<li><p>Charlotte yoga is a lifesaver.  Can she do Rails tutorials in her soothing voice?  Breathe in through the nostrils, Movies has_many Actors.  Now breathe out through the mouth &ndash; AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHhhh h h</p></li>
<li><p>4 weeks left.  Let&rsquo;s have some fucking fun.</p></li>
</ul>
