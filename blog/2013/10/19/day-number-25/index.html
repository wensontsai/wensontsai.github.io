			<p>The ebb and flow of intense emotions and experiences takes me up and leaves me at sea.  The sight of land is a luxury no one can expect &ndash; the rising and setting sun will simply have to do.  My friend, they talk about connecting the dots only in hindsight.  It&rsquo;ll all make sense then, like some tiny islands, when you hop lead you to the main piece, the big show, the motherland.  They talk about fumbling forth, fingers grasp fistfuls of darkness.  They, talk about many things.  When you live, the voices have nowhere to go, or maybe they are close, but your ears cannot process them as the wind rushes by and through your body, a just cracked window in a car makes an epic soundtrack &ndash; living a bit reckless is better than thinking cautious riding pine &ndash; at least I say.  And through it all, through this all, that&rsquo;s what I still say.  Bold.  I know.  Self-assured.  Cocksure.  Sure.  I feel young, and all things possible.  The grim and the grime of lesser times cannot hold on much longer.  It just can&rsquo;t.  And then on and on, it&rsquo;ll go.  To the next adventure lined up to see.</p>

<p>Today, was great.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people are scared to say shit is great.  They fear that maybe, it actually doesn&rsquo;t qualify as great.  Perhaps people around them will think they have shit standards, because what they proclaimed publicly as GREAT, was actually SHIT.  They cast doubt to say so also because, maybe, they think, the amounts of greats we have is limited, and if you keep having GREATs, then all the shit days leftover will come tumbling down and crush your spine, making you a paralyzed shitty cyborg living a life that&rsquo;s worse than death itself, that&rsquo;s why you always say shit is mediocre!  Just alright.  At best, meh!  Although, secretly inside, it was kinda really fucking good man, and you know it.  Shhh, don&rsquo;t let the fates know, or else they&rsquo;ll start distributing strife to balance the scales!  This is not the justice we seek.  Let the fates do what it do.  Your job is to be great, to experience as many great moments as you possibly can, to feel great as much as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Today, I was treated to a tour of WeWork offices today, dynamic, electric, packed with dream-chasers, start-ups, boutique operations, artists, fashionistas, free beer, free arcades, lots of glass with marker scribble, 30th floor New York Views, and conference call phone booths.  Then, I had fish friday (king fish at Veronica&rsquo;s Kitchen food truck (the red sannnper is better)).  Then, I came back, figured out some last minute code to link the cart in our kickstarter project, got it to work, presented our site to the class, then the rest of the day was art class (a visual and conceptual primer before we dive into HTML/CSS next week).  I&rsquo;ve never painted on canvas before but it was therapeutic, fun, expressive, and reminded me of why since long ago I chased and fantasized about that crazy artist life so hard and never ever fully let go.  After, a few of us Fullstackers walked to Chinatown and ate soup dumplings at this place my cousin recommended (Shanghai Cafe).  It was good, and I caught the train, somehow found the way home, and Rob at school found my iphone (cause I left it at Fullstack).  Tomorrow is the weekend to continue working on our kickstarter project (cause our group is having so much fun we still on it like Voltron), and there&rsquo;s a hackathon to attend, and I will meditate, and do laundry, eat a great lunch, and do everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do ever if I only had time, until the realization that it is 4pm on Sunday sets in &ndash; the weekend is over &ndash; and become slightly sad at all the things I now &ldquo;have to do&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;want to do,&rdquo; then get over it, wonder where another week of my life went, then eventually freak out at how awesome and possible everything that ever existed ever was again because it&rsquo;s now next Friday afternoon/evening (aka Golden Hour).  Then again.  And again.  and Again.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not great though.</p>
