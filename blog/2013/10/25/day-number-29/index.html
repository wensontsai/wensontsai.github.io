			<p>Ro-bro-riffic.  This is an issue like with all non-native languages.  I took Chinese for 10 years, and was iffy but could wing it.  Then I went off to Japan and learned Japanese.  To this day, unless I&rsquo;m on day 7 of a 2 week trip into the hinterlands of China, Japanese is going to come out when I try to speak Chinese.  My wires are all crossed up.  I got one foreign language position and inevitably it just edge each other out for dominance.</p>

<p>This is not to say, I can&rsquo;t speak both, I just got to ease into each one when the time is right, and the one I use most frequent and most often is default stronger.  I am hoping with Javascript and Ruby, both computer and not complete cultural transitive languages, that I got more sockets for that (there&rsquo;s a gem for that).</p>

<p>Time will tell.  Ruby speaks okay English to me now.  Javascript is more like Beowulf in Olde English &ndash; tedious, non-sensical, with just enough slight surprises to make you perk, but also make you yell WHYY at the air.  My current solution to all these WHYY>??S is to just sprinkle semicolons and curly braces everywhere.  ;};;}:;}:};:}}:};}:}}}:}  .  I give you these little tasty symbols you like to eat, you be my friend and run appropriately, see?  Works for housecats.</p>

<p>As I JUST learned yesterday after a string of very creative yet very wrong questions based on wrong assumptions (how did you name that function with dynamic strings that you can iterate over the numbers within the name string itself??!), Javascript is an entirely different beast upon and to itself.  Ruby is definitely the playground bully gum in the middle spiral of your hair.  But Javascript is running around with HTMl in different ways.  It&rsquo;s more like gum in your sideburns and your bangs too.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I&rsquo;m quite to the point of describing these languages as tools.  I&rsquo;m definitely getting a lot better at using keyboard shortcuts though!  Soon, I will throw away any and all mice(mouses) I own.  Soon.</p>

<p>I am most excited about&hellip; one day not playing catch-up anymore.  Although, that still seems a bit down the line.  I am excited about eventually having the freedom to known how to build shit.  To have an idea and be able to see into and through the machine, to intuitively understand the steps, and be able to lay it out in code, connect the dots, and have it go live and be alive.  Still feel like I&rsquo;m running drills and doing two hand dribbling practices.  Coach not putting me in the game yet.</p>
