			<p>I been real crispy lately.  Reallll crispy.  Maybe it&rsquo;s the days shortening, maybe it&rsquo;s the weather coldening, maybe, it&rsquo;s just the pressure from the mountain of strain and rush, materials marked to be learned that bury deeper and deeper under newer materials that also need to be learned, on top of more materials yet needing to be learned, causing fissure, crush goes the heap.  Crush goes the heap.  It&rsquo;s not easy for someone to admit they&rsquo;ve done put in the 330%, made the laps, and it still doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s even close to being enough, but I&rsquo;m tired.  Crispy and tired.  There&rsquo;s so much I want to execute, want to improve on, projects I want to initiate, the flesh is willing to run itself even more, perhaps even never sleep again, but the spirit, it rebels.</p>

<p>The spirit wants to sit down and eat a slow, thoughtful and sensual meal over 47 minutes.  It wants to walk gradual in nature and hear nothing but the wind.  It wants to sit with people it feels close to, do nothing &ndash; nothing but just be.  The spirit wants to become music and forget that there is anything else ever in the history of space and time.  It wants to not have anything to do, even be bored out of its wits.  The spirit wants to know that everything is fine and good, so sufficiently good enough, just the very way it is.</p>

<p>The immersive learning structure is intense.  I know all of you motherfuckers coming into this sit there and go &ldquo;Oh no, not me.  Not motherfucking me.  I&rsquo;ll grasp this shit like a wolf stealing a dead baby unlike your dis-talented ass!&rdquo;  Well, good luck to you.  I have the backing of the best friends and family in the world, all the reason in this very moment any human being would ever need to be motivated for success/work/money and then some, the hunger of a thousand lost dreams consolidated into a burping busting steam engine, years-cultivated habits of hardwork and success, a broad range of earned experiences and various toolkits to grab from, I&rsquo;ve taught myself about anything under the sun with relative ease over the years, and I still feel like I&rsquo;m majorly getting rocked.</p>

<p>This is not to say, that you couldn&rsquo;t pick it up with ease.  It&rsquo;s just to say, hey, best of luck.  And, I mean it.  Good luck if this becomes your path.  Keep yourself strong.</p>

<p>Tomorrow marks half of the course.  It will be 6 weeks.  In truth, 6 weeks is a miniscule blip of time for doing anything, let alone learning anything, let alone steering into uncharted tech waters, taking on a new way of thinking never attempted, absorbing an assortment of programming languages, computer science philosophy, start-up culture, business practices, and everything else we&rsquo;ve been dipping our hands and toes in these past few weeks.  It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this life, it won&rsquo;t be exactly this way forever.  Even in the densest aggregations of struggle, there is much to be cherished.  I know this.</p>

<p>I know this.</p>

<p>But the spirit wants a 2 day weekend, the spirit wants to eat good meals, not stuff food to silence hunger in order to quickly return to work.  The spirit wants to bike all over the city and effervescently choose joy over efficiency, the spirit wants to talk shit and smile with pretty girls, the spirit wants to play the drums for hours on end, dance, the spirit wants to laugh till its stomach hurts and throws up a little.  The spirit wants freedom to do whatever the hell it wants even if it has no chance in hell of leading to a job/career/money.  The spirit wants to be good at shit and be validated for it (however meaningless external validation can be it still feels good).  The spirit grows tired of calling out without being heard.  The spirit feels, at best, impartial towards github.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this life, it won&rsquo;t be this way forever.  Even in the most poignant moments of loneliness and struggle, there is much to be treasured.  See the beauty as it rises and passes away.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s temporary.</p>
