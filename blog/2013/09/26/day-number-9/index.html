			<p>We wrapped up the Ruby/SQL query middle-layer build exercise today.  It was good.  Way envious of what my partner can just see, solve, and code.  While my brain pulls blanks, he&rsquo;s got gears turning, and with the gear-turning you got stuff to try.  I like trying stuff.  Running code, whether right or wrong, may be a distant cousin of slot machines.  Gimme more code for me nickel slots.</p>

<p>We then got into groups to present about classes vs instances, class methods vs instance methods.  They say teaching is the best way to learn.  To teach, you got to feel like you got it under wraps.  Then to bring someone outside of yourself to understanding, well that&rsquo;s a whole nother thing.</p>

<p>I believe in giving.</p>

<p>Not as some tax write-off, but as a human activity we all should be involved in.  To be honest, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter what you give.  It&rsquo;s just important to reach outside of yourself, help others, be connected &ndash; there&rsquo;s a true joy in it.</p>

<p>Information is definitely one of the easiest things to give.  But not necessarily one of the easiest to receive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling pretty lucky watching the teachers at Fullstack.  It turns on the lights in that teacher part of me I nurtured in Japan.  I would have stayed as late as possible or done about anything to help my students grow and understand.  Few rewards are better than being there to usher someone along and change their lives.  I get why in traditional Chinese society, teachers and intellectuals were the most respected social class.  I get why being a teacher in Japanese society pretty much means you are a public pillar of society and a parent to your students for life.</p>

<p>A good teacher will inevitably change the lives of their students.</p>

<p>To believe in someone when they had no faith, to shine a light where they knew not to look, a good teacher gives themselves &ndash; the student and teacher are one &ndash; their growth is your growth, their achievement, your achievement.  We all run on limited time in this life.  Time is our most precious resource.  How else can you feel but grateful for another who spends their minutes improving yours?</p>

<p>I feel lucky that we are the first class at Fullstack.  I know from my own experience, I was able to give the most to the very first graduating class I taught.  Routine and the tear of putting yourself out there over and over can wear even the best.  It&rsquo;s definitely better to be Taiwan than Korea **.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information and the guidance.  Thank you for your dedication, time, faith, support, and encouragement.  It is an inspiration.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I will hold up my end of the deal.</p>

<p>** When Japan was trying to put an empire together to compete with the &lsquo;civilized West&rsquo; (ironically out of a fear of being colonized themselves) they planned to make Taiwan their model first colony.  They pumped infrastructure into there, and although there was conflict, it&rsquo;s quite a stark contrast from when Japan tried to colonize Korea.  Taiwan still has a soft spot for Japan until this day, where as revenge on Japan has been a fire under Koreans for the past half century.</p>
