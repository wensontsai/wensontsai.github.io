			<h6>What is the most interesting thing you learned this week?</h6>

<p>The most interesting thing I&rsquo;ve smuggled into the toolbelt this week is the realization that any motion is always better than no motion.  What I mean is, when you are stuck on a problem, you&rsquo;ve been staring to the point where the back of the eyes are strangely hot like your optic nerve is going to just explode out the back of your skull, when you are doubting everything you&rsquo;ve ever believed in and wondering if going home and crying in the shower will truly &ldquo;make it all go away,&rdquo; in those sweltering moments of deep isolation, your best option is to always keep it moving.  Search online for a solution.  Pick up a pen and draw diagrams, flow-charts, break down your thought process.  Ask someone.  Go back to tutorials and start coloring with numbers again.  Anything.  Just don&rsquo;t sit there and let that steam build up to the point where the lid must blow off.  It&rsquo;s a dance, a dance within yourself to keep searching, to keep creative, to never quit, to never die.</p>

<h6>What kind of things are you struggling with?</h6>

<p>I feel like I am playing a giant game of catch up.  I feel unprepared and wonder if I may be overextending myself.  I wish I had another few slow months to really lock in the basics covered in the pre-work.  I struggle with syntax and little things like where in a loop the array loader needs to be.  I forget to put &lsquo;end&rsquo;s sometimes.  Rspec confuses me and I think it may be evil.  Rspec may be evil.  I have no idea what it wants and it&rsquo;s never happy.  Conceptually, git is still sounding like the matrix to me.  But, I&rsquo;m working on it.  I&rsquo;m learning a lot, and when piling things on so it soak in and osmosize &ndash; I know it supposed to hurt a bit &ndash; kinda like when you water drought-ridden arid soil &ndash; the first few moments are mostly water running everywhere except down.  I&rsquo;m with it.  Mostly, I wish there was another me, and we could github our brains and merge our learning so I could get some extra sleep, do a little more nothing, even pick up some drum sticks and do some basic patterns.  Please find a way to clone me, then github our brains.</p>

<h6>What learning techniques are working for you?</h6>

<p>Everything.  You cats are great!  I&rsquo;m so glad this isn&rsquo;t a scam!  Hahaha.  Coming back to the US and hearing about this severe job demand/supply gap and 3month immersives in a field new to me, many people are skeptical like, can this be true?  Do these guys really know what they are doing?  After I send the deposit, show up on my friend&rsquo;s couch, will I follow the address on first day of class to a pretzel stand in the Bronx and have to call CBS&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Lookout&rdquo;?  No.  I&rsquo;m thoroughly enjoying everything that&rsquo;s been going on.  I find the balance of self-struggle, self-discovery and communal group/pair solution resolution tactics to be very fruitful.  The improv lessons have also stayed with me (I wrote about it in the Day1 post below), and I value the interconnected nature of all this.  I want to continue to learn how to be competitive, aim for the best within myself and for everyone around, without losing perspective on end-goals or my own personal values.</p>

<h6>What you thought about pair programming?</h6>

<p>I had a great time yesterday and found it to be an extremely enjoyable and enlightening process.  I wrote about it more in the post below.  My partner and I were even wondering at one point, did you guys purposely put us together knowing our skillsets at this current moment, or were we giving you guys too much credit?  Hahah.  Please keep the credit.  I learned a lot about how there&rsquo;s always spaces for you to help the project along, fill in the gaps.  When my partner got too lost in the details of trying to understand API functions, I would try and shift gears so we could continue to make progress in finishing the work.  And, it really felt like floating yesterday (a rare sensation seeing as its been a bloodbath through the Testfirst exercises).  We finished very early on, with seemingly little pain or effort.  We joked about how we had become addicted to struggle like a wife in a domestic violence relationship.  Punch me so I can feel alive!  That&rsquo;s a horrible joke, I&rsquo;m sorry.  But, really, things can be smooth, flow, be fun, and still work right.  It happened yesterday.</p>
