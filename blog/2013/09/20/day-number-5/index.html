<p>I witnessed the sly smile first hand from David, and heard the &ldquo;Why&rsquo;d you tell him?&rdquo; from Nimit, as they leaked joy that was the hackathon today.  Really, all anyone ever has to say, is ROBOTS.  Even I know that.  ROBOTS are a free pass to boner time.</p>

<p>What I didn&rsquo;t know was that Legos have advanced to an unimaginable level of complexity.  I&rsquo;d really like to meet the kids that can do this shit.  A room full of grown ass people were bent, slapped &ndash; some resembled psychiatric ward regulars staring off into nothing, jabbing little lego joints into pegs into balls into wings into what looked like pre-fused hair clips and chewy swords &ndash; this continued for hours.  Our group fared no better.  In fact, I was convinced we were the worst.</p>

<p>Today was legions different than my pair-programming experience yesterday.  Our group was unfocused, lost, trudging, achingly dead in the mud.  I was frustrated with them.  I was frustrated with myself. I&rsquo;d really really wanted to win.  It seemed impossible now.  I mean, if they&rsquo;re not into it, they&rsquo;re just not, right?  I took a breather on the rooftop and contemplated defeat.</p>

<p>The other groups seemed to super have it together.  The potential burn of embarassment would be difficult.  An entire day&rsquo;s worth of work, and not anything to show for except a robot with swords for hair.  It says in huge print &ldquo;Ages 10+&rdquo; right on the box.  Fucking genius kids with their little sweat-shop-perfect hands.  The outside change of scenery opened up just enough of a gap to sneak through &ndash; I softened.  Maybe everyone wanted to work harder, but were just burnt to a crisp at the end of this first week.  It was Friday.  And, I was exhausted too.  Maybe today, texting for one of the teammates was necessary &ndash; family stuff?  maybe he was going through a breakup or something.  Who knows.  It didn&rsquo;t matter, they were still good people to me.</p>

<p>I went back in.  After getting some advice and understanding the rules of the game, threw out a complete hackjob of a plan, and then got to making it work.  The goal being for the robot to run around, collect cans, and move them outside the border, I figured we could just run diagonals, bouncing off all the borders, sweeping the cans out and win on speed &ndash; desperate solutions for desperate times.  The robot remained inexplicably hobbled for the next hours &ndash; I loudly vowed I would run into the ring like a crazed overprotective mother, kicking cans in every direction.  &ldquo;Do you know how hard my baby has worked on this?  Stop laughing!  Don&rsquo;t make me come over there!!&rdquo;  Plan B:  The Tiger Mom solution would ensure knocked cans, and this way our defeat, though still hideously embarassing, would be at least memorable.</p>

<p>Then, a funny thing happened.</p>

<p>One of David&rsquo;s CTO friends showed up and offered to help us.  Then David jumped in to help us.  Our team member ranks had grown to 6 or 7.  Then our team began to pull together.  The robot division expanded on the idea of better sweeper arms that made the difference at the last minute.</p>

<p>Then, this absurdist theater cockfight began &ndash; a live feed on the wall.  I must tell you, maybe it was the delusion-inducing fatigue, or the 1.5 beers, but it was exciting and riveting as hell.  These 4 runs had the drama, tragedy, and comedy of Roman gladiator bouts.  I can&rsquo;t even explain it.</p>

<p>Then.  We won.  Team Onionz, who aspired to crush the competition into tears, instead finding themselves in tears, found new tears of relief, surprise, gratefulness and joy for the undeserved, unexpected help and results.  My winner&rsquo;s ring pop was broken but so sweet nonetheless.</p>

<p>Then, a beer spilled on my brand new Macbook Air (breaking it in as a true tool and not just some cool-status ornament).  Then.  I ate tons of raw broccoli.  And then, David&rsquo;s mom dropped science on me.</p>

<p>Never quit, the wise lady told me.  All you have to do, is never quit.</p>
