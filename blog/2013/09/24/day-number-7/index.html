			<p>Rough.  That&rsquo;s all I can really say.  The going is rough.  It&rsquo;s full-on Rocky over here without the benefit of a Netflix summary telling you everything&rsquo;s gonna wrap up okay at the end of 1:45hrs run-time.  Driving rough.</p>

<p>We finished up the Rspec blackjack testing/coding endeavor today, didn&rsquo;t gain too much more ground on getting greens and drowning red failure statements.  Even after all was explained and done, I still felt drowny and heavy all up in the chest.  We then moved on to learning SQL.  Oh syntax, you are the worst ex-girlfriend of them all, I swear.</p>

<p>The crotch punches continued deep into dusk, with little to no tea-refill breaks (we were out of water tanks for the dispenser so I put some green tea in some seltzer water.  a bubbly gassy fail.) the abuse remained a flurry until our Fullstack Dinner ++ today where we were treated to a delicious and balanced meal from Digg Inn, loved ones and friends joined us, mostly I think, so they could lock in a mental/emotional picture for imagining where their significant other/loved ones are when they don&rsquo;t ever see them in person again until December.  It&rsquo;s busy up in here.</p>

<p>I was so tired and defeated, but soon summoned to life.  The two girls in the class beckoned me over to sit between them.  The other Taiwanese-American guy in the class mentored me about my life.  Apparently he was a movie producer on the side, all the while having his hands in the tech VC world.  Very interesting, and unexpected.  I spilled a bit of my past lives, and there we were in the middle of a long table, talking shop in that weird snooty entertainment industry way, making jokes about crafty and trail mix.  I always did love being on set.</p>

<p>He buckled down tough-love style, but I was listening.  His message? to focus down what exactly I wanted to get out of this experience &ndash; also, what I wanted to get out of the life I had remaining.  This intensity was really happening at the same table we ate bagels and cream cheese every morning, except with people all around watching the spectacle, but they didn&rsquo;t really exist anyway.  He gave me a lot to think about.</p>

<p>As people came and went, another group formed, and these two other students began talking about their dedication to working on personal projects.  Unexpected inspiration again.  I felt electrified to hear of them wishing this place had a shower so they could work around the clock to get stuff done.  We are already 10% of the way through the program, one said.  He&rsquo;s right.  Better get on it.</p>

<p>I will come up with a passion project of my own to spearhead the learning and networking and NASA fall-out transfer technologies and make me portfolio pretty and give me lots of fire when I talk about things I care about, get the toes and fingers all wet and sticky again in the cauldron of life and creativity and imagination and possibilities and yes.  I think there will be a capstone project before we finish anyways, and it will be fantastic to have a vehicle to push everything forth as I leave gravity behind and burn, burn, burn it up through the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The last few short and sudden hours have reminded me that eyes keep focused solely on the road, it miss the scenery.  The unseen benefits of a road trip are many.</p>
