		<div class="content">
			<p>Today was fun.  We started off in pairs to work out a ruby/csv/html/erb/gem cocktail collab that would get us mass-emailing, and mass-texting long-lost friends and family to go check out our octopress blogs ~ this blog right here.  Maybe we were drunk off the power of knowing we could soon be spamming the crap out of the White House, bringing down governments, facilitating coups and peoples&#8217; revolutions, or downright quivering, peering down the slide to darkness as we pressed &lsquo;return&rsquo; each time running the code &ndash; each time understanding this could be the end of all friendships/pleasant human relationships as we know it.  Now that I know how, it will take all the self-restraint in the heavens, all the self-control in the universe, to not spam the shit out of you all every day, my loved ones.</p>

<p>First time out working with a partner, I was teamed up with an ex-pro-gambler/trader, a real genius builder.  We made a great team, for my contributions seemed to weigh more in seeing larger picture motifs, a macro-scope, at least today, while he had a tendency to get locked into the intricacies, the minutiae of the code, micro-scope if you will &ndash; these things he readily admitted to me.  And, although we spent much time bonding over a variety of topics including potential start-up ideas, rebel pirate currency potentialities, and our love of experiencing new food/cuisine, we still managed to breeze through the work as if it was no sweat.  So much so, I constantly feared we were skipping something large in our work.</p>

<p>David talked about pair-programming in being a crash course in scope &ndash; in navigating and in driving (we shared one computer), in seeing across the entire vista, and in locking down telescope-style.  This got me thinking about so many other things.  For focus and an awareness of scope is a vital concept.</p>

<p>There are some really bright and interesting people around me.  David and Nimit, the two founders/owners/teachers, also beam genuine &ndash; they&rsquo;re funny, generous, sharp as fuck, and almost make me think twice about why I fought entering the 9-to-5/typical working world/money/career world so hard when I first left college.  Certainly, not everyone in the working world ends up in middle-management with sweat-stained short-sleeve dress shirts, a collection of ugly ties, a friendly-enough-but-passively-aggressive wife, the 1.5 kids, infinite mortgage, incessantly pestered with the marrow-deep kind of trapped/addicted-to-comfort suburbian veneer which constantly nags if you truly know what being alive is anymore.</p>

<p>Here, there is a hunger.  There is a lust.  Aspirations.  Dreams.  Youth.  Renewal.  There is a hope.  An excitement.  A robust drive.  I feel it within myself as well.  If the previous 5 year block of my life were soft pats and warm hugs from the universe, this last year and a half has been slave-lashings and Muy Thai jumping knees to the kidneys.  Blood in the urine, is nothin more than Red No.10 in your seltzer.  Blood is in the mind.</p>

<p>And here I am.  And here we are.  We are taking the leap and the skip and the jump.  Never lose sight of how far you&rsquo;ve come, where you want to go, and how you want to go to where you want to go.</p>

<p>Even as you fly, keep your preciousness close.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes well on you.</p>
