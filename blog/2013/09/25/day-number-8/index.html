			<p>Today was pleasant.  We wrapped up the sqlite3 workshop we had begun.  I dig it, man.  Inner joins are just like crappy 80&rsquo;s arcade versions of mah-jong (ain&rsquo;t got nothing on the real tiles).  You match up pairs and they disappear.  You want the win? you match up the faces &ndash; pretty much for joins, you got to be as indirect as possible.  You match up two obviouses, just so you can get your in-obvious column.  I can appreciate the mystery and the behind-room-divider finesse.</p>

<p>After we got a handle on SQL commands, we dove back into Ruby, turning each table into a class object, and columns into attributes.  We were to build the middle layer for Ruby to interact with SQL &ndash; building a helper.</p>

<p>It was around then while working through some discrepancies that I came to realize how meta everything was getting.  It used to be just data, basic containers to keep that data, keys to access that data, but now we were dealing with objects.  Objects are only objects in so much as you can imagine a container in the paper of your mind.  We were beyond information you can scribble in a notebook, or wrap in neat curly braces.  Objects.  Are objects even real?  Do objects care if we feel pain?  The information, the words you had before, they&rsquo;re thrown into objects and turned into mere attributes.  Attributes of the object!  What is this &lsquo;object&rsquo;?  A blender for all things real?  How cold!  Your name, your tastes, they have meaning, personality &ndash; in a curly bracket, square bracket, parentheses, they are still themselves, just in a room.  But, in objects &ndash;  now, they were part of the machine.  Emotionless attributes now.  Accessed as so.  Mere markers, of what used to be.</p>

<p>And, right then and there, I had an existential breakdown.</p>

<p>Are we human, or are we object?</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just a mere instance of the human class (think human factory).  I run methods like eat, walk, love, make_babies, make_poo, ponder_the_meaning_of_life, laugh, flirt, talk_shit.  I can make_the_world_a_better_place taking arguments like giving, or caring, or I can run methods steal, or murder(with_knife) or destroy(with_emotional_abuse).  And many more pre-programmed actions.</p>

<p>You ever done these online personality quizzes, or done the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator full-on with in-depth explanations regarding your tendencies, world perspective, thought processes, and intuitions?  I read one once just a few months prior that had me ALL FIGURED OUT.  Down to the most secret and fundamental of my instincts that I had put energy into developing, practice into trusting.</p>

<p>It was as if I was exactly where I was supposed to be, just that I, the one it was happening to, was the only one that didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I, me, whatever, exerting effort, right at the cusp of believing in progress, manuevering new directions, but everything I discovered, someone some thing already knew I would think, act, make sense this way, even as I was convinced I was doing everything of my own will and volition.  A simple text, I&rsquo;d never seen, already knew I would be trying to do so and predicted it.  It freaked me the fuck out.</p>

<p>Was it feasible that our destinies and fates could be so thinly veiled?  That the train and the track could glide ever so blatantly eye-to-eye?  How could it be, that life seems so original, so real, subjectively, yet be so easily uncovered and predictable?  I felt so ordinary, so cliche, so played-out, so kitsch.  Was I human, or was I object?  And, was I this way all along?  Why didn&rsquo;t anyone tell me?</p>

<p>Or,</p>

<p>was I supposed to feel this way, at this very point in time, as the fates and destinies and programming purposely pre-aligned &ndash; which was first, the chicken, the egg?  Could a chicken lay the very egg it is hatching out of simultaneously, just in time to lay another egg, which contains none other than itself?  What if the eggs were not chicken eggs at all, but duck eggs, with a purple-grey dead duck baby inside, and the Vietnamese friends you were drinking with told you to spoon lime juice with black pepper/chili paste onto its face and slurp &ndash; would it taste like cajun crawfish, even though it&rsquo;s neither cajun NOR crawfish??</p>

<p>How
fucking
predictable.</p>

<p>Hello World!
