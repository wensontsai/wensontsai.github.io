			<p>I said it over and over on the train.  No little programs will destroy me.  So, I may not have a deep technical background, so, I may not have much experience with this.  So, I may not have finished the pre-work yet, and class has already started (believe you me, I wish I&rsquo;d gotten through it all with time to spare, but when doors open, they blow open.  your job is to step through).  Pig-latin is not the end of me.</p>

<p>And so, off to the races.  Unbelievable, it&rsquo;s only day 3.  I&rsquo;m a native New Yorker now.  And a Wall St. banker.  Complaining about long lunch lines at the 1pm rush, talking with Yonkers accents.  BONNKAAZZZ &ndash; like the guy in the elevator yesterday, who Jorge unfortunately said &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to out of kindness, and in a small 3x5 box, moving upwards at a rate of 10ft/hr, he complained about how the microphone on his smashed phone was a mess, and he had to use headphones in order to talk &ndash; in his words, this, &ldquo;a living hell.&rdquo;  New York&rsquo;s a different world.  Talking with headphones is a severe deal breaker, take note, kids.</p>

<p>Solutions were given today for the Testfirst.org problems yesterday.  After yesterday&rsquo;s owning, I was feeling discouraged.  Things got a lot better after I managed to solve a few problems by my own, and now the guy next to me was looking at my answers to get some green test throughs.  David explained the &lsquo;yield&rsquo; method in greater detail, after dropping the science on answers, and I felt much, much better.  After class tutorial small group study sessions?  Yes, please.  As many as you got.  I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>

<p>We got a new project to work on that will take us the rest of the week, a few hours before go-home.  I have not even touched the haiku problem yet from yesterday.  I want to crack at it.  And there&rsquo;s so much pre-work I still want to do, and I want to do the testfirst problems over as well.  So much to do, not so much time.</p>

<p>I have fallen into the NYC pace of non-stop, much like a small child leaping backwards into a mountain of laundry, on a perched but soft bed.</p>
