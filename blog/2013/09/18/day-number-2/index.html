			<p>Day two, we started off getting our github/Octopress pages configured and set up.  Hit some snags early on, and it felt like the entire day was all catch up.  The afternoon was spent going through Testfirst.org&rsquo;s Ruby Rspec exercises.</p>

<p>This was extremely confusing at first, since Rspec has its own language, and you must read through it, figure exactly what it is looking for, name your files, classes, methods appropriately, to pass the tests.  What also confused me majorly was not having to print to screen, not having to write the code to finish &ndash; just barebones methods, classes were sufficient.  Cause as you know &ndash; methods always return the last value!</p>

<p>After lunch, catch up became a trudge through Vietnam jungle mud with angry charly in the trees &ndash; problems became immovable, and the brain liquified.  By 4:30pm I was pretty much baked.  With the gracious help of others around, I hacked on and on and always made sure to wrap my head around the principles more than anything else.  Syntax.  Pssh, suck it syntax!!</p>

<p>The day would come to be marked by the pig-latin problem.  Write a method that will take a phrase, separate that into words, turn each word into pig-latin, then pump it back out as a phrase.  Simple-sounding enough right?  No.  Not at all.  This problem haunted and broke me over and over until Day 3&rsquo;s explanation in the morning.</p>

<p>Day two was a solid 12 hours.  I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I went this hard.  It&rsquo;s been a while.  We also had our first Fullstack Dinner tonight, which was good, but brief, as we all had to get back to work.  Back to work!</p>

<p>I got home around 1030pm, couldn&rsquo;t leave pig-latin alone &ndash; worked another 2 hours, drawing diagrams, scribbling notes, then crashed out, still confused.  Super burnt.  Super frustrated.</p>

<p>Well, mountains look highest next to the deepest valleys.  I&rsquo;m sure some wise dude with a beard once said.</p>
