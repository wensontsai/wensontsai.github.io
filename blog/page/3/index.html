		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/18/day-number-3/">I will be better today</a></h1>
		<time>18 September 2013</time>

			<p>I said it over and over on the train.  No little programs will destroy me.  So, I may not have a deep technical background, so, I may not have much experience with this.  So, I may not have finished the pre-work yet, and class has already started (believe you me, I wish I&rsquo;d gotten through it all with time to spare, but when doors open, they blow open.  your job is to step through).  Pig-latin is not the end of me.</p>

<p>And so, off to the races.  Unbelievable, it&rsquo;s only day 3.  I&rsquo;m a native New Yorker now.  And a Wall St. banker.  Complaining about long lunch lines at the 1pm rush, talking with Yonkers accents.  BONNKAAZZZ &ndash; like the guy in the elevator yesterday, who Jorge unfortunately said &ldquo;hi&rdquo; to out of kindness, and in a small 3x5 box, moving upwards at a rate of 10ft/hr, he complained about how the microphone on his smashed phone was a mess, and he had to use headphones in order to talk &ndash; in his words, this, &ldquo;a living hell.&rdquo;  New York&rsquo;s a different world.  Talking with headphones is a severe deal breaker, take note, kids.</p>

<p>Solutions were given today for the Testfirst.org problems yesterday.  After yesterday&rsquo;s owning, I was feeling discouraged.  Things got a lot better after I managed to solve a few problems by my own, and now the guy next to me was looking at my answers to get some green test throughs.  David explained the &lsquo;yield&rsquo; method in greater detail, after dropping the science on answers, and I felt much, much better.  After class tutorial small group study sessions?  Yes, please.  As many as you got.  I&rsquo;ll be there.</p>

<p>We got a new project to work on that will take us the rest of the week, a few hours before go-home.  I have not even touched the haiku problem yet from yesterday.  I want to crack at it.  And there&rsquo;s so much pre-work I still want to do, and I want to do the testfirst problems over as well.  So much to do, not so much time.</p>

<p>I have fallen into the NYC pace of non-stop, much like a small child leaping backwards into a mountain of laundry, on a perched but soft bed.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/18/day-number-2/">peaks need valleys</a></h1>

			<p>Day two, we started off getting our github/Octopress pages configured and set up.  Hit some snags early on, and it felt like the entire day was all catch up.  The afternoon was spent going through Testfirst.org&rsquo;s Ruby Rspec exercises.</p>

<p>This was extremely confusing at first, since Rspec has its own language, and you must read through it, figure exactly what it is looking for, name your files, classes, methods appropriately, to pass the tests.  What also confused me majorly was not having to print to screen, not having to write the code to finish &ndash; just barebones methods, classes were sufficient.  Cause as you know &ndash; methods always return the last value!</p>

<p>After lunch, catch up became a trudge through Vietnam jungle mud with angry charly in the trees &ndash; problems became immovable, and the brain liquified.  By 4:30pm I was pretty much baked.  With the gracious help of others around, I hacked on and on and always made sure to wrap my head around the principles more than anything else.  Syntax.  Pssh, suck it syntax!!</p>

<p>The day would come to be marked by the pig-latin problem.  Write a method that will take a phrase, separate that into words, turn each word into pig-latin, then pump it back out as a phrase.  Simple-sounding enough right?  No.  Not at all.  This problem haunted and broke me over and over until Day 3&rsquo;s explanation in the morning.</p>

<p>Day two was a solid 12 hours.  I don&rsquo;t remember the last time I went this hard.  It&rsquo;s been a while.  We also had our first Fullstack Dinner tonight, which was good, but brief, as we all had to get back to work.  Back to work!</p>

<p>I got home around 1030pm, couldn&rsquo;t leave pig-latin alone &ndash; worked another 2 hours, drawing diagrams, scribbling notes, then crashed out, still confused.  Super burnt.  Super frustrated.</p>

<p>Well, mountains look highest next to the deepest valleys.  I&rsquo;m sure some wise dude with a beard once said.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/17/day-number-1/">Day #1</a></h1>
		<time>17 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>The morning was spent shaking off nerves with laughs, dark jokes, and dancing as we threw ourselves in a course of improv.  It was a great way to get out of our shells, look dumb in front of a room of strangers/new friends, and get us in the right mindset to be team-players.</p>

<p>Lessons to take away:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Yes, AND&hellip;</strong>   &ndash; Always accept what your fellow player gives you, AND try to give them something back that they can work with, a little gift.  &ldquo;No&rdquo;/questions take the energy somewhere else unproductive with the flow</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Always show up</strong>   &ndash; No matter if you are scared, unprepared or what, just show up and create in the moment from there.  That&rsquo;s the most important.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Help them out</strong>   &ndash; When you see a fellow player in trouble, jump in and save them.  Don&rsquo;t let them die alone out there!</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The afternoon was just as invigorating as we jumped straight into setting up our Fullstack profile pages off a minimal template.  It was HTML/CSS in action, as well as a challenge in vision &ndash; to create a stylesheet, requires understanding how to work within the defaults/habits of HTML/CSS.  It was a leap into madness with divs, nested divs, floats, and the beauty hack of the &ldquo;clearfix.&rdquo;  This was all after setting up Github and learning how to commits as well.</p>

<p>I got most of the page looking like it was supposed to, but then spent the last 2 hours trying to get some links to hug right and to the bottom.  It just wasn&rsquo;t meant to be.  As a last ditch effort, I tried to renest one of the divs by putting the main quote into a class of its own, and leaving the links outside to text-align: right.  THEN, I noticed a div tag that I forgot to close.  I closed that, then scooted a few things around, and the page just went to shit.  Everything became unaligned, and CTRL-Z became the very bestest friend I could have ever had.  Backsteps off the lava cliff jump.  And so, it wasn&rsquo;t perfect, but it was something.</p>

<p>I rushed out fast for the first time in a week &ndash; headed off to the Apple Store to replace the battery on my brand new Macbook Air.  Here&rsquo;s to 12 hours of battery time.</p>
