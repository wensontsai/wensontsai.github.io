			<p>I&rsquo;m excited about things.  Ideas, progress.  I finally cracked through a RSpec till all green completion alllmmost by myself earlier today.  Triumph.  Rails is becoming more sensible.  We have an evaluation tomorrow.  Too tired, can&rsquo;t read my many furious notes.  Study in the morning.  Also, note to self, no more 7-day continuous study/work weeks &ndash; Sunday must be an off-day.  Okay, friend.  Also, must eat lunch every day &ndash; skimming by on cereal is no bueno.  Check.  Got some inspirato from fellow classmate/comrade regarding project today.  Gonna run it by the pros (Dave &amp; Nim), flesh out more, and maybe it be hackable.  Exciting.  Reading book on start-up culture over weekend.  Looking forward to it.  Earlier today, we had a code-typing-speed relay competition.  Spice it up.  Macbook chicklet keys usually low-pro and smooth to touch, but not as fancy when your fingers shaking from nerves.  Werd.</p>

			<p>Cat claws be latching my jeans, like Rails latch me brain.  We worked on putting the StackWorld website room warp project onto pure Rails today, and it was a good chance to wrap our heads around the whole structure, MCV, behind-the-scenes voodoo, all that jazz.  I had my sleep and ate more of my bagel than I usually do, had toooo many cups of green tea, was amped, and driving, driven, and droven.  Head down, forking and porking, it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it was doable.  Definitely doable.  It&rsquo;s always the little hiccups that get you.  Misspellings, effing misspellings.  Am I misspelling mispelings now? oh soh me-tta.  Mis-spellings will mess you up man.  And this whole Rails-so-smart-it-know-plurals! mess, will also mess you up.  Remember &ndash; models => singular.  Controller => plural.  This saves trouble, keeps nosebleed blood inside brain.  Tomorrow is coming.  Tomorrow will come soon.  I must sleep.</p>

		<time>05 October 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<p>I wish I had some great metaphor or anecdote that would move you right here, crumble the mountains and shake the shores, but I don&rsquo;t.  I just got reality in my pockets, and life in my veins.  And, it&rsquo;s gonna have to be enough.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>This is informed both by the current state of affairs in code-land, but also by my own personal affairs back home.  The bridge isn&rsquo;t hard to forge.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Friday, we worked on crawlers to gank links off our Stackworld pages from the day before.  Gank, recursive; self-replicating viruses of gankdom.</p>

<p>Saturday, I&rsquo;m here again, but I&rsquo;m not really here.  I&rsquo;m giving it all I got in time, energy, and mind, but other things got my heart.  And, I think that&rsquo;s okay.  Not everything&rsquo;s a straight-line, even in immersive 3month programs.  Goals, achievements, careers, fancy/expensive pieces of paper, jobs, all these little applications, still need to be made available by the server of health, love, and life.  I&rsquo;m especially reminded of that today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a drawing I made trying to understand things:</p>

			<p>With the coming autumn/winter season, people are flipping out about colds/viruses/flus and the such, hand-sanitizer companies are padding their expense accounts in hand-sanitizer company-like ways like a company scavenger hunt in a landfill followed by a company picnic.  Free hand-sanitizer for all involved including family/friends, of course!  In my mind, companies and employees of said companies all joyously and single-mindedly pursue the seamless integration of their product into their lives &ndash; hence a hand-sanitizer company employee just CAN&rsquo;T WAIT to test the extent of hand-sanitizer power in their lives and really stick it to those germs!  Following this example, I will save my exposition on the valor and robustness of condom-company employees for another day when morale is truly low.  You simply won&rsquo;t believe what a couple hundredths of a millimeter of latex will embolden an otherwise sane human being to attempt.  For the company!</p>

<p>Sickness, illness, colds.  I see at them as life&rsquo;s breaks.  If your body can&rsquo;t fight off a common cold, it&rsquo;s probably because you are overextended.  We all work so hard, sometimes something outside of ourselves mercifully taps us on the shoulder, and puts the brakes on for us.  Colds, even the flu, they are more opportunities for rest than outside invaders that must be defeated.  The body is strong and knows what to do.  Trust it.  Rest it.</p>

<p>Today, started off as another high-aspiration day as we do at Fullstack Academy, but for some reason we caught a cold.  Well, the campus did &ndash; the internet went out.  For a tech house, wifi is the air in your nostrils.  Time to blow the nose, sip some soda, watch TV and sleep &ndash; we took it easy today.  I think once all of our internal meth-rock-chewing slave-drivers surrendered to the idea that we were not getting anything done until the internet was back on, we were able to let go of the pace; some of us even left the building, went outside, took a stroll, overlooked the water, stared off into nothing, lied down on the boardwalk.</p>

<p>Of course, it was easy to figure exactly when the internet was back on &ndash; silence, heads returned downward at a slight 78degrees &ndash; plugged in, dropped out &ndash; back in the machine.</p>

<p>We still managed to cover Ruby regular expressions, and discuss web crawling.  Tomorrow we construct scrapers, I am excited about these little script-robots we&rsquo;ll be getting a handle on.  The read-ups sound ever-so slightly suspect though &ndash; this is where hackers(as in trying to make code work) and hackers(as in breaking into code that&rsquo;s not theirs) begin to get some bridges.  I like it.</p>

			<p>The Active Record/Sinatra/SQLite collabo.. wait, did we start it yesterday or fresh today?  Who knows anymore.  I just had to check my own blog, to write my own blog.  Head in a fog, log, bog, smog, brog.  Today was fun.  We made weird worlds, and I put chips and salsa everywhere, and David put guac, and Nimit hi-jacked my macbook like a Somali pirate and I&rsquo;m that new Tom Hanks movie where it&rsquo;s stressful and he grows a beard and keeps order over his seamen.  Surely persistence and the drive to discover is how you learn (so that&rsquo;s how you get good at things!).</p>

<p>Week 3 of the program, rolling along &ndash; thinking that we are already 25% of the way through the course, puts the fear in me like a lake of fire/gnashing of teeth next to the devil could never instill.  YOU ARE ALREADY &frac14; OF THE WAY THROUGH WITH YOUR WEB DEV IMMERSIVE SOON YOU WILL TAKE THE SKILLS YOU HAVE ACQUIRED FIND A JOB AND START WORKING WITH SAID SKILLS ON THE DAILY FOR MONEY.  This statement, is so fucking scary, it could be used in your favor to convert me to any religion/religions/causes/cults/sex-cults/porno-cage-dungeons of your heart&rsquo;s desire.  Yes, I will do porn if you just keep yelling that sentence at me.  I&rsquo;m so scared, yes, I&rsquo;m ready to shoot!!</p>

<p>In less scary news, or actually, rather debatable, check out what I made at school today mama!</p>

<p><a href="https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new">https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new</a></p>

<p>Come on in, have some chips n salsa in the foyer, kick up a shoe or two, pee in my double golden toilets (made of real gold, not that plated stuff), take a bounce or three in my double moon bounces, and check out some real meat in the dry-age-room/muscle dungeon.  But only if you dare.  Don&rsquo;t eat spaghetti squash in front of your keyboard while you explore these wormholes either, soldier.  Also, go ahead, put in your name (I&rsquo;ll never see it), create some rooms and add items to your heart&rsquo;s content (I will see these), and make some connections between those rooms to keep Wenson Stack World spicier than a mala pepper gone down the wrong throat path.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy.  Here, to help things along, I&rsquo;ll tell/show you about myself.</p>

			<p>Today, we had our 3rd Fullstack Dinner, and it was pizza.  Grandma&rsquo;s pizza, Grandpa&rsquo;s pizza, White pizza, mushroom pizza (which no one touched inexplicably) &ndash; the pizza game be diversified.  The day was one with a good flow &ndash; we first learned about the internets.  The internets is busy, and it keeps passing stuff back and forth like basketball drills to keep us seeing things and un-revolty.  The US government was down today (effing ridiculous), but hey, it&rsquo;s fine when you can watch people do things on Brobible.com (mind sanitize).</p>

<p>Then we moved on to designing this multi-room portal site pulling in Sinatra, Rails(Active Record), SQL, and HTML/CSS which was pretty cool, cause it lets people come onto your site, and then create a room and name things.  Of course, the first room I named was the toilet, because every good space including a wormhole, needs a toilet (keep it hyperspace-clean, son!).  My butt cheeks be allergic to anything that&rsquo;s not gold even when I&rsquo;m space-dimensional-contiuum-irrespective-morphing/traveling.</p>

			<p>I thought it would take me the next 5 years of my life, but with a shit-ton of help and explanation, failed thought process/approaches, hipchat support, sacrifice of a saturday, housecat jealousy, pure grudgery sprinkled on top, I re-wrote the code for the pig-latin testfirst.org problem, got it to work, and also understand it.</p>

<p>Arrays to strings to arrays to arrays to strings to goddamnit computer, why cant you just think the way I think, and we can be friends and share the same underpants?  You don&rsquo;t wear underpants.</p>

		<div class="content">
			<p>We wrapped up the Ruby/SQL query middle-layer build exercise today.  It was good.  Way envious of what my partner can just see, solve, and code.  While my brain pulls blanks, he&rsquo;s got gears turning, and with the gear-turning you got stuff to try.  I like trying stuff.  Running code, whether right or wrong, may be a distant cousin of slot machines.  Gimme more code for me nickel slots.</p>

<p>We then got into groups to present about classes vs instances, class methods vs instance methods.  They say teaching is the best way to learn.  To teach, you got to feel like you got it under wraps.  Then to bring someone outside of yourself to understanding, well that&rsquo;s a whole nother thing.</p>

<p>I believe in giving.</p>

<p>Not as some tax write-off, but as a human activity we all should be involved in.  To be honest, it doesn&rsquo;t even matter what you give.  It&rsquo;s just important to reach outside of yourself, help others, be connected &ndash; there&rsquo;s a true joy in it.</p>

<p>Information is definitely one of the easiest things to give.  But not necessarily one of the easiest to receive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m feeling pretty lucky watching the teachers at Fullstack.  It turns on the lights in that teacher part of me I nurtured in Japan.  I would have stayed as late as possible or done about anything to help my students grow and understand.  Few rewards are better than being there to usher someone along and change their lives.  I get why in traditional Chinese society, teachers and intellectuals were the most respected social class.  I get why being a teacher in Japanese society pretty much means you are a public pillar of society and a parent to your students for life.</p>

<p>A good teacher will inevitably change the lives of their students.</p>

<p>To believe in someone when they had no faith, to shine a light where they knew not to look, a good teacher gives themselves &ndash; the student and teacher are one &ndash; their growth is your growth, their achievement, your achievement.  We all run on limited time in this life.  Time is our most precious resource.  How else can you feel but grateful for another who spends their minutes improving yours?</p>

<p>I feel lucky that we are the first class at Fullstack.  I know from my own experience, I was able to give the most to the very first graduating class I taught.  Routine and the tear of putting yourself out there over and over can wear even the best.  It&rsquo;s definitely better to be Taiwan than Korea **.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information and the guidance.  Thank you for your dedication, time, faith, support, and encouragement.  It is an inspiration.</p>

<p>Believe you me, I will hold up my end of the deal.</p>

<p>** When Japan was trying to put an empire together to compete with the &lsquo;civilized West&rsquo; (ironically out of a fear of being colonized themselves) they planned to make Taiwan their model first colony.  They pumped infrastructure into there, and although there was conflict, it&rsquo;s quite a stark contrast from when Japan tried to colonize Korea.  Taiwan still has a soft spot for Japan until this day, where as revenge on Japan has been a fire under Koreans for the past half century.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/09/25/day-number-8/">are we human, or are we object</a></h1>
		<time>25 September 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Today was pleasant.  We wrapped up the sqlite3 workshop we had begun.  I dig it, man.  Inner joins are just like crappy 80&rsquo;s arcade versions of mah-jong (ain&rsquo;t got nothing on the real tiles).  You match up pairs and they disappear.  You want the win? you match up the faces &ndash; pretty much for joins, you got to be as indirect as possible.  You match up two obviouses, just so you can get your in-obvious column.  I can appreciate the mystery and the behind-room-divider finesse.</p>

<p>After we got a handle on SQL commands, we dove back into Ruby, turning each table into a class object, and columns into attributes.  We were to build the middle layer for Ruby to interact with SQL &ndash; building a helper.</p>

<p>It was around then while working through some discrepancies that I came to realize how meta everything was getting.  It used to be just data, basic containers to keep that data, keys to access that data, but now we were dealing with objects.  Objects are only objects in so much as you can imagine a container in the paper of your mind.  We were beyond information you can scribble in a notebook, or wrap in neat curly braces.  Objects.  Are objects even real?  Do objects care if we feel pain?  The information, the words you had before, they&rsquo;re thrown into objects and turned into mere attributes.  Attributes of the object!  What is this &lsquo;object&rsquo;?  A blender for all things real?  How cold!  Your name, your tastes, they have meaning, personality &ndash; in a curly bracket, square bracket, parentheses, they are still themselves, just in a room.  But, in objects &ndash;  now, they were part of the machine.  Emotionless attributes now.  Accessed as so.  Mere markers, of what used to be.</p>

<p>And, right then and there, I had an existential breakdown.</p>

<p>Are we human, or are we object?</p>

<p>I mean, I&rsquo;m just a mere instance of the human class (think human factory).  I run methods like eat, walk, love, make_babies, make_poo, ponder_the_meaning_of_life, laugh, flirt, talk_shit.  I can make_the_world_a_better_place taking arguments like giving, or caring, or I can run methods steal, or murder(with_knife) or destroy(with_emotional_abuse).  And many more pre-programmed actions.</p>

<p>You ever done these online personality quizzes, or done the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator full-on with in-depth explanations regarding your tendencies, world perspective, thought processes, and intuitions?  I read one once just a few months prior that had me ALL FIGURED OUT.  Down to the most secret and fundamental of my instincts that I had put energy into developing, practice into trusting.</p>

<p>It was as if I was exactly where I was supposed to be, just that I, the one it was happening to, was the only one that didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I, me, whatever, exerting effort, right at the cusp of believing in progress, manuevering new directions, but everything I discovered, someone some thing already knew I would think, act, make sense this way, even as I was convinced I was doing everything of my own will and volition.  A simple text, I&rsquo;d never seen, already knew I would be trying to do so and predicted it.  It freaked me the fuck out.</p>

<p>Was it feasible that our destinies and fates could be so thinly veiled?  That the train and the track could glide ever so blatantly eye-to-eye?  How could it be, that life seems so original, so real, subjectively, yet be so easily uncovered and predictable?  I felt so ordinary, so cliche, so played-out, so kitsch.  Was I human, or was I object?  And, was I this way all along?  Why didn&rsquo;t anyone tell me?</p>

<p>Or,</p>

<p>was I supposed to feel this way, at this very point in time, as the fates and destinies and programming purposely pre-aligned &ndash; which was first, the chicken, the egg?  Could a chicken lay the very egg it is hatching out of simultaneously, just in time to lay another egg, which contains none other than itself?  What if the eggs were not chicken eggs at all, but duck eggs, with a purple-grey dead duck baby inside, and the Vietnamese friends you were drinking with told you to spoon lime juice with black pepper/chili paste onto its face and slurp &ndash; would it taste like cajun crawfish, even though it&rsquo;s neither cajun NOR crawfish??</p>

<p>How
fucking
predictable.</p>
