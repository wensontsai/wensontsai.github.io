			<![CDATA[<p>Ro-bro-riffic.  This is an issue like with all non-native languages.  I took Chinese for 10 years, and was iffy but could wing it.  Then I went off to Japan and learned Japanese.  To this day, unless I&rsquo;m on day 7 of a 2 week trip into the hinterlands of China, Japanese is going to come out when I try to speak Chinese.  My wires are all crossed up.  I got one foreign language position and inevitably it just edge each other out for dominance.</p>

<p>This is not to say, I can&rsquo;t speak both, I just got to ease into each one when the time is right, and the one I use most frequent and most often is default stronger.  I am hoping with Javascript and Ruby, both computer and not complete cultural transitive languages, that I got more sockets for that (there&rsquo;s a gem for that).</p>

<p>Time will tell.  Ruby speaks okay English to me now.  Javascript is more like Beowulf in Olde English &ndash; tedious, non-sensical, with just enough slight surprises to make you perk, but also make you yell WHYY at the air.  My current solution to all these WHYY>??S is to just sprinkle semicolons and curly braces everywhere.  ;};;}:;}:};:}}:};}:}}}:}  .  I give you these little tasty symbols you like to eat, you be my friend and run appropriately, see?  Works for housecats.</p>

<p>As I JUST learned yesterday after a string of very creative yet very wrong questions based on wrong assumptions (how did you name that function with dynamic strings that you can iterate over the numbers within the name string itself??!), Javascript is an entirely different beast upon and to itself.  Ruby is definitely the playground bully gum in the middle spiral of your hair.  But Javascript is running around with HTMl in different ways.  It&rsquo;s more like gum in your sideburns and your bangs too.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I&rsquo;m quite to the point of describing these languages as tools.  I&rsquo;m definitely getting a lot better at using keyboard shortcuts though!  Soon, I will throw away any and all mice(mouses) I own.  Soon.</p>

<p>I am most excited about&hellip; one day not playing catch-up anymore.  Although, that still seems a bit down the line.  I am excited about eventually having the freedom to known how to build shit.  To have an idea and be able to see into and through the machine, to intuitively understand the steps, and be able to lay it out in code, connect the dots, and have it go live and be alive.  Still feel like I&rsquo;m running drills and doing two hand dribbling practices.  Coach not putting me in the game yet.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>I been real crispy lately.  Reallll crispy.  Maybe it&rsquo;s the days shortening, maybe it&rsquo;s the weather coldening, maybe, it&rsquo;s just the pressure from the mountain of strain and rush, materials marked to be learned that bury deeper and deeper under newer materials that also need to be learned, on top of more materials yet needing to be learned, causing fissure, crush goes the heap.  Crush goes the heap.  It&rsquo;s not easy for someone to admit they&rsquo;ve done put in the 330%, made the laps, and it still doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s even close to being enough, but I&rsquo;m tired.  Crispy and tired.  There&rsquo;s so much I want to execute, want to improve on, projects I want to initiate, the flesh is willing to run itself even more, perhaps even never sleep again, but the spirit, it rebels.</p>

<p>The spirit wants to sit down and eat a slow, thoughtful and sensual meal over 47 minutes.  It wants to walk gradual in nature and hear nothing but the wind.  It wants to sit with people it feels close to, do nothing &ndash; nothing but just be.  The spirit wants to become music and forget that there is anything else ever in the history of space and time.  It wants to not have anything to do, even be bored out of its wits.  The spirit wants to know that everything is fine and good, so sufficiently good enough, just the very way it is.</p>

<p>The immersive learning structure is intense.  I know all of you motherfuckers coming into this sit there and go &ldquo;Oh no, not me.  Not motherfucking me.  I&rsquo;ll grasp this shit like a wolf stealing a dead baby unlike your dis-talented ass!&rdquo;  Well, good luck to you.  I have the backing of the best friends and family in the world, all the reason in this very moment any human being would ever need to be motivated for success/work/money and then some, the hunger of a thousand lost dreams consolidated into a burping busting steam engine, years-cultivated habits of hardwork and success, a broad range of earned experiences and various toolkits to grab from, I&rsquo;ve taught myself about anything under the sun with relative ease over the years, and I still feel like I&rsquo;m majorly getting rocked.</p>

<p>This is not to say, that you couldn&rsquo;t pick it up with ease.  It&rsquo;s just to say, hey, best of luck.  And, I mean it.  Good luck if this becomes your path.  Keep yourself strong.</p>

<p>Tomorrow marks half of the course.  It will be 6 weeks.  In truth, 6 weeks is a miniscule blip of time for doing anything, let alone learning anything, let alone steering into uncharted tech waters, taking on a new way of thinking never attempted, absorbing an assortment of programming languages, computer science philosophy, start-up culture, business practices, and everything else we&rsquo;ve been dipping our hands and toes in these past few weeks.  It&rsquo;s a lot.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this life, it won&rsquo;t be exactly this way forever.  Even in the densest aggregations of struggle, there is much to be cherished.  I know this.</p>

<p>I know this.</p>

<p>But the spirit wants a 2 day weekend, the spirit wants to eat good meals, not stuff food to silence hunger in order to quickly return to work.  The spirit wants to bike all over the city and effervescently choose joy over efficiency, the spirit wants to talk shit and smile with pretty girls, the spirit wants to play the drums for hours on end, dance, the spirit wants to laugh till its stomach hurts and throws up a little.  The spirit wants freedom to do whatever the hell it wants even if it has no chance in hell of leading to a job/career/money.  The spirit wants to be good at shit and be validated for it (however meaningless external validation can be it still feels good).  The spirit grows tired of calling out without being heard.  The spirit feels, at best, impartial towards github.</p>

<p>Like everything else in this life, it won&rsquo;t be this way forever.  Even in the most poignant moments of loneliness and struggle, there is much to be treasured.  See the beauty as it rises and passes away.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s temporary.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Michael Nutt, co-founder and CTO of Moveable Ink (<a href="https://moveableink.com">https://moveableink.com</a>) rolled through to drop some knowledge and experience tonight for Fullstack talk/dinner.  He came up with the idea for Moveable Ink on a Friday, coded a rough through the weekend, worked with no revenue for a year, but it took off and it&rsquo;s been going places ever since.  Also, Michael beat out 400 developers in the Hacking Education contest which encourages the public to make discoveries and build apps to improve education in America.  Pretty cool stuff.  Then Stephen Colbert awarded him the most American-y trophy ever, and he got to sit in the chair and the set of the Colbert Report (<a href="http://www.donorschoose.org/blog/2011/07/25/stephen-colbert-anoints-big-winner/">http://www.donorschoose.org/blog/2011/07/25/stephen-colbert-anoints-big-winner/</a>).</p>

<p>Michael was the guy who came over and helped us get our lego robot to work that fateful first Fullstack Friday eons ago &ndash; I had no idea he was such a start-up kingpin, tech and dev wizard &ndash; he&rsquo;s the nicest, most approachable guy.  Not to say talented, hard-working, and successful people are assholes &ndash; I just didn&rsquo;t know he had so many other important things to be doing instead of playing legos!</p>

<p>Today he spoke to us about scaling your business once it begins to take off, giving us insights on the app and database side of things.  It was a bit over my head, but really nice to hear.  Afterwards, a fellow student seemed a bit bewildered as well and felt lost.</p>

<p>I got these thoughts right then though, that one day we would be there.  Like, it&rsquo;s overwhelming now, because we&rsquo;re still trying to work out the basics, and they&rsquo;re talking high-level strategy.  You can&rsquo;t weave the defense, spin and glide, before you get your dribble down.  But once you got it like second nature, then you can focus on court vision, creativity, jerk and flow like a painting.  And, once you got that down, you can practice true inter-dependence and lead a team of 11 to victory.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll get there, I told him.  We&rsquo;ll get there.  It might not be on our plate right now, but it&rsquo;s on the table.  It&rsquo;s on the spread.  We&rsquo;ll get there.  Bring on the stories, the glory, the pain, the losses, the wins.  I like feeling like I can be in the game.  I like knowing I can be there.  Call my name so I may turn my head and see what tasty-goodness is available.  Point it out so I may smell it, dream, plot, werk and twerk.  Put notice on, so I may figure out how to get it on my plate because I&rsquo;m hungry.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>The ebb and flow of intense emotions and experiences takes me up and leaves me at sea.  The sight of land is a luxury no one can expect &ndash; the rising and setting sun will simply have to do.  My friend, they talk about connecting the dots only in hindsight.  It&rsquo;ll all make sense then, like some tiny islands, when you hop lead you to the main piece, the big show, the motherland.  They talk about fumbling forth, fingers grasp fistfuls of darkness.  They, talk about many things.  When you live, the voices have nowhere to go, or maybe they are close, but your ears cannot process them as the wind rushes by and through your body, a just cracked window in a car makes an epic soundtrack &ndash; living a bit reckless is better than thinking cautious riding pine &ndash; at least I say.  And through it all, through this all, that&rsquo;s what I still say.  Bold.  I know.  Self-assured.  Cocksure.  Sure.  I feel young, and all things possible.  The grim and the grime of lesser times cannot hold on much longer.  It just can&rsquo;t.  And then on and on, it&rsquo;ll go.  To the next adventure lined up to see.</p>

<p>Today, was great.</p>

<p>Sometimes, people are scared to say shit is great.  They fear that maybe, it actually doesn&rsquo;t qualify as great.  Perhaps people around them will think they have shit standards, because what they proclaimed publicly as GREAT, was actually SHIT.  They cast doubt to say so also because, maybe, they think, the amounts of greats we have is limited, and if you keep having GREATs, then all the shit days leftover will come tumbling down and crush your spine, making you a paralyzed shitty cyborg living a life that&rsquo;s worse than death itself, that&rsquo;s why you always say shit is mediocre!  Just alright.  At best, meh!  Although, secretly inside, it was kinda really fucking good man, and you know it.  Shhh, don&rsquo;t let the fates know, or else they&rsquo;ll start distributing strife to balance the scales!  This is not the justice we seek.  Let the fates do what it do.  Your job is to be great, to experience as many great moments as you possibly can, to feel great as much as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Today, I was treated to a tour of WeWork offices today, dynamic, electric, packed with dream-chasers, start-ups, boutique operations, artists, fashionistas, free beer, free arcades, lots of glass with marker scribble, 30th floor New York views, and conference call phone booths.  Then, I had fish friday (king fish at Veronica&rsquo;s Kitchen food truck (the red sannnper is better)).  Then, I came back, figured out some last minute code to link the cart in our kickstarter project, got it to work, presented our site to the class, then the rest of the day was art class (a visual and conceptual primer before we dive into HTML/CSS next week).  I&rsquo;ve never painted on canvas before but it was therapeutic, fun, expressive, and reminded me of why since long ago I chased and fantasized about that crazy artist life so hard and never ever fully let go.  After, a few of us Fullstackers walked to Chinatown and ate soup dumplings at this place my cousin recommended (Shanghai Cafe).  It was good, and I caught the train, somehow found the way home, and Rob at school found my iphone (cause I left it at Fullstack).  Tomorrow is the weekend, an opportunity to continue working on our kickstarter project (cause our group is having so much fun we still on it like Voltron), or my own personal project, or the Rails Rumble project, and there&rsquo;s a hackathon to attend, and I will meditate, and do laundry, eat a great lunch, and do everything I&rsquo;ve ever wanted to do ever if I only had time, until the realization that it is 4pm on Sunday sets in &ndash; the weekend is over &ndash; and I become slightly sad at all the things I now &ldquo;have to do&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;want to do,&rdquo; then get over it, wonder where another week of my life went, then eventually freak out at how awesome and possible everything that ever existed ever was again because it&rsquo;s now next Friday afternoon/evening (aka Golden Hour).  Then again.  And again.  and Again.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s still great though.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Rails is making more sense (and losing its magic).  I am getting the sense (sixth) more &ndash; to know where to dig &ndash; controller, model, views, routes.  Working through this project, I feel I got a better grasp of what the controller and the model does and how to divide &ldquo;za bizness&rdquo; between the two.  I got a better idea of how the associations work and how to worm through those associations and methods to find the exact value you are looking for.  I would like to practice more model associations/method accessing in the future to really solidify the feel.</p>

<p>Working in a team of 4 this time was fun and a dream.  We used Trello as our hub strategy (strategery), and we&rsquo;d break, go off into the wilderness, forage for working code (delicious code mushrooms), come back, share our discoveries, then push (git push) the project forward.  I know it won&rsquo;t always be this easy, maybe we just hit a good flow this time, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that it can.  In the beginning, I personally felt that we were trying to install too many features right off the get-go (especially after reading &lsquo;Getting Real&rsquo; all Sunday, I&rsquo;d become a devoted acolyte), but we eventually threw everything into the Trello product backlog and found a way as a group to focus first on the essentials.  It also helped that there was soooo much work to be done that we kinda knew we&rsquo;d just be chewing and chewing, and however much we bit through, was gonna just be that.  Being at a buffet with a stapled stomach takes the pressure off.  I like group work.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>What a difference some sleep makes.  I&rsquo;m finally caught up on rest after the weekend.  It&rsquo;s Wednesday.  It&rsquo;s not even about having crazy weekends, it&rsquo;s about not working yourself to death(you&rsquo;ll always feel like you don&rsquo;t have enough time if you simply feel that way), then not blowing off steam recklessly (sleeping at 5am two nights in a row will really rock your sleep schedule).  It&rsquo;s about balance.  Knowing how to take time to pace and not work 14 days in a row (bad idea), then knowing how to go see friends but not stay out late to make up for working 14 days straight (bad idea + bad idea = just bad idea).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been hearing this from various sources lately, and it&rsquo;s a good piece to keep around &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a marathon, not a sprint.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s going to take time for new concepts, a brand new way of thinking, a brand new way of looking at the world, to truly sink in.  This is probably gonna change the way your brain puts everything together, so be patient.  If you do find yourself in a mad scram up a 90deg slope, just know, this is kinda what it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m progressing.  I&rsquo;m soaking it all up.  It&rsquo;s coming.  It&rsquo;s been a month really.  I&rsquo;m relearning America too (personal struggle).  Show up, show up, show up.  Show up, pace, keep fun, keep joy, and cruise.  Eye-of-the-storm.  Eezy peezy.</p>

<p>Today, we continued chopping up and rolling out like Navy Seals on this kickstarter project.  We scrum in Trello, then break, handle our parts, then git push, clear our commits, then group pull back down like we are sitting at some cotton spider-loom of interweb construction.  With guidance, we managed to install Stripe&rsquo;s credit-card payment API onto our page as checkout.  It&rsquo;s simple and barebones, but exciting.  Mostly because to test it, I keep paying myself lots of imaginary ducats and my customer count keeps climbing.  Soon I&rsquo;ll be rolling deep like 37signals and DHH, getting 10,000+ github commits, people flying me to talk about which Ruby gem is my favorite, which unicode symbol I prefer on my prompt during the Autumn Equinox, hipchatting honey-babies in my Bugatti, as I drip start-up ideas all over the place like a child discovering honey, money.</p>

<p>Man, it&rsquo;s a different world.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Day 2 of kickstarter/crowdtilt.  We break chunks.  We scrum with the best of them.  We are the scrummiest.  Sometimes you non-stop win, other times you tear your sweater on a splinter &ndash; it&rsquo;s all good, you&rsquo;re still in the game.  Today, tackled and cleared up (to a certain extent) more under-hood Rails voodoo.  Associations are like untangling really thin and long earphone cables.  Patience, man, patience.  You wanna hear the music, don&rsquo;t you?  Did you know all about these things Rails is doing behind your back?  Creating 11 methods just because you said &lsquo;has_many&rsquo;?  Hey.  Surprise on me.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s coming together, though.</p>

<p>Any progress is good progress.  And a whole bunch of other mantra type shit.  It&rsquo;s all true.</p>

<p>Until it&rsquo;s not true.</p>

<p>Our usual Fullstack Tuesday dinners was had yesterday when Andy, a freelance developer came by to share his vision of a trans-global life &ndash; free to work, free to be (which in his case is running marathons all over the world including Kenya and Alaska(?).  His current client wouldn&rsquo;t care if he was gone for 6mos on a beach in Thailand as long as his git pushes kept coming through and clean.  I&rsquo;m willing to stretch it to 1 or 2 yrs.  First, got to get the builder skills up though, wrestle some open source, get a few gems named after me and my body parts.</p>

<p>Late in the day, I invented an app that will aggregate people&rsquo;s grandmas and then farm them out to stranger&rsquo;s homes where they cook people really kickass home-meals for money.  Grandma Swap.  Or, maybe more like Grandma Pimp, huh.  Will the SPCA be mad at me?  I promise they&rsquo;re all free-range grandmas.  If anyone is interested in trusting me with your grandmas, let me know.  I&rsquo;m an old lady&rsquo;s dream.</p>

However much I&rsquo;ve learned at this point, I&rsquo;m not even sure &ndash; I&rsquo;m just used to the struggle.  Today, we began constructing our own version of kickstarter/crowdtilt.  It&rsquo;s a meaty one for sure.  Working through it will only solidify the Rails understanding deeper.  Javascript will come soon as well, and then, the world.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m excited about things.  Ideas, progress.  I finally cracked through a RSpec till all green completion alllmmost by myself earlier today.  Triumph.  Rails is becoming more sensible.  We have an evaluation tomorrow.  Too tired, can&rsquo;t read my many furious notes.  Study in the morning.  Also, note to self, no more 7-day continuous study/work weeks &ndash; Sunday must be an off-day.  Okay, friend.  Also, must eat lunch every day &ndash; skimming by on cereal is no bueno.  Check.  Got some inspirato from fellow classmate/comrade regarding project today.  Gonna run it by the pros (Dave &amp; Nim), flesh out more, and maybe it be hackable.  Exciting.  Reading book on start-up culture over weekend.  Looking forward to it.  Earlier today, we had a code-typing-speed relay competition.  Spice it up.  Macbook chicklet keys usually low-pro and smooth to touch, but not as fancy when your fingers shaking from nerves.  Werd.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Cat claws be latching my jeans, like Rails latch me brain.  We worked on putting the StackWorld website room warp project onto pure Rails today, and it was a good chance to wrap our heads around the whole structure, MCV, behind-the-scenes voodoo, all that jazz.  I had my sleep and ate more of my bagel than I usually do, had toooo many cups of green tea, was amped, and driving, driven, and droven.  Head down, forking and porking, it wasn&rsquo;t easy, but it was doable.  Definitely doable.  It&rsquo;s always the little hiccups that get you.  Misspellings, effing misspellings.  Am I misspelling mispelings now? oh soh me-tta.  Mis-spellings will mess you up man.  And this whole Rails-so-smart-it-know-plurals! mess, will also mess you up.  Remember &ndash; models => singular.  Controller => plural.  This saves trouble, keeps nosebleed blood inside brain.  Tomorrow is coming.  Tomorrow will come soon.  I must sleep.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>After a weekend, that didn&rsquo;t feel much like a weekend because it was spent catching up on pre-work and learning about Rails, Monday rolled on forth with more Rails.  I was kinda glad I stayed in and brushed up, and by brushed up, I mean learned for the first time, Rails, because we dove right into it today.  Sinatra &ndash; out.  Rails in.  Rails is crazy cause with 2 command line returns, there&rsquo;s this mass of folders and controllers, routes, models, html/css that&rsquo;s just blegghgh right there.  Kinda like how this morning I awoke to my friend&rsquo;s cat wailing and making caulking-gun sounds.  I open the door, and there it was.  All this vomit everywhere.  Hello, Ruby on Rails generate scaffold function!</p>

<p>Still working out the kinks, the connections, and my feelings towards this whole framework.  I went to a childhood friend&rsquo;s place for dinner and he asked me, so what does Rails do when you build a website?  Good question.  I just told him it&rsquo;s like some sort of glue that seeps in and makes things easier between html and SQL, and everything&hellip; um, yeah.  That&rsquo;s Rails!  Get&rsquo;s all up in there, you know?  Kinda like that cat vomit is all up inbetween the wood planks.  That&rsquo;s part of the house now.</p>

<p>Oh man, Rails, what have they been feeding you?</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>I wish I had some great metaphor or anecdote that would move you right here, crumble the mountains and shake the shores, but I don&rsquo;t.  I just got reality in my pockets, and life in my veins.  And, it&rsquo;s gonna have to be enough.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>This is informed both by the current state of affairs in code-land, but also by my own personal affairs back home.  The bridge isn&rsquo;t hard to forge.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Friday, we worked on crawlers to gank links off our Stackworld pages from the day before.  Gank, recursive; self-replicating viruses of gankdom.</p>

<p>Saturday, I&rsquo;m here again, but I&rsquo;m not really here.  I&rsquo;m giving it all I got in time, energy, and mind, but other things got my heart.  And, I think that&rsquo;s okay.  Not everything&rsquo;s a straight-line, even in immersive 3month programs.  Goals, achievements, careers, fancy/expensive pieces of paper, jobs, all these little applications, still need to be made available by the server of health, love, and life.  I&rsquo;m especially reminded of that today.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard, but we walk anyway.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a drawing I made trying to understand things:</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>With the coming autumn/winter season, people are flipping out about colds/viruses/flus and the such, hand-sanitizer companies are padding their expense accounts in hand-sanitizer company-like ways like a company scavenger hunt in a landfill followed by a company picnic.  Free hand-sanitizer for all involved including family/friends, of course!  In my mind, companies and employees of said companies all joyously and single-mindedly pursue the seamless integration of their product into their lives &ndash; hence a hand-sanitizer company employee just CAN&rsquo;T WAIT to test the extent of hand-sanitizer power in their lives and really stick it to those germs!  Following this example, I will save my exposition on the valor and robustness of condom-company employees for another day when morale is truly low.  You simply won&rsquo;t believe what a couple hundredths of a millimeter of latex will embolden an otherwise sane human being to attempt.  For the company!</p>

<p>Sickness, illness, colds.  I see at them as life&rsquo;s breaks.  If your body can&rsquo;t fight off a common cold, it&rsquo;s probably because you are overextended.  We all work so hard, sometimes something outside of ourselves mercifully taps us on the shoulder, and puts the brakes on for us.  Colds, even the flu, they are more opportunities for rest than outside invaders that must be defeated.  The body is strong and knows what to do.  Trust it.  Rest it.</p>

<p>Today, started off as another high-aspiration day as we do at Fullstack Academy, but for some reason we caught a cold.  Well, the campus did &ndash; the internet went out.  For a tech house, wifi is the air in your nostrils.  Time to blow the nose, sip some soda, watch TV and sleep &ndash; we took it easy today.  I think once all of our internal meth-rock-chewing slave-drivers surrendered to the idea that we were not getting anything done until the internet was back on, we were able to let go of the pace; some of us even left the building, went outside, took a stroll, overlooked the water, stared off into nothing, lied down on the boardwalk.</p>

<p>Of course, it was easy to figure exactly when the internet was back on &ndash; silence, heads returned downward at a slight 78degrees &ndash; plugged in, dropped out &ndash; back in the machine.</p>

<p>We still managed to cover Ruby regular expressions, and discuss web crawling.  Tomorrow we construct scrapers, I am excited about these little script-robots we&rsquo;ll be getting a handle on.  The read-ups sound ever-so slightly suspect though &ndash; this is where hackers(as in trying to make code work) and hackers(as in breaking into code that&rsquo;s not theirs) begin to get some bridges.  I like it.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>The Active Record/Sinatra/SQLite collabo.. wait, did we start it yesterday or fresh today?  Who knows anymore.  I just had to check my own blog, to write my own blog.  Head in a fog, log, bog, smog, brog.  Today was fun.  We made weird worlds, and I put chips and salsa everywhere, and David put guac, and Nimit hi-jacked my macbook like a Somali pirate and I&rsquo;m that new Tom Hanks movie where it&rsquo;s stressful and he grows a beard and keeps order over his seamen.  Surely persistence and the drive to discover is how you learn (so that&rsquo;s how you get good at things!).</p>

<p>Week 3 of the program, rolling along &ndash; thinking that we are already 25% of the way through the course, puts the fear in me like a lake of fire/gnashing of teeth next to the devil could never instill.  YOU ARE ALREADY &frac14; OF THE WAY THROUGH WITH YOUR WEB DEV IMMERSIVE SOON YOU WILL TAKE THE SKILLS YOU HAVE ACQUIRED FIND A JOB AND START WORKING WITH SAID SKILLS ON THE DAILY FOR MONEY.  This statement, is so fucking scary, it could be used in your favor to convert me to any religion/religions/causes/cults/sex-cults/porno-cage-dungeons of your heart&rsquo;s desire.  Yes, I will do porn if you just keep yelling that sentence at me.  I&rsquo;m so scared, yes, I&rsquo;m ready to shoot!!</p>

<p>In less scary news, or actually, rather debatable, check out what I made at school today mama!</p>

<p><a href="https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new">https://dry-tundra-6501.herokuapp.com/person/new</a></p>

<p>Come on in, have some chips n salsa in the foyer, kick up a shoe or two, pee in my double golden toilets (made of real gold, not that plated stuff), take a bounce or three in my double moon bounces, and check out some real meat in the dry-age-room/muscle dungeon.  But only if you dare.  Don&rsquo;t eat spaghetti squash in front of your keyboard while you explore these wormholes either, soldier.  Also, go ahead, put in your name (I&rsquo;ll never see it), create some rooms and add items to your heart&rsquo;s content (I will see these), and make some connections between those rooms to keep Wenson Stack World spicier than a mala pepper gone down the wrong throat path.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be shy.  Here, to help things along, I&rsquo;ll tell/show you about myself.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>Today, we had our 3rd Fullstack Dinner, and it was pizza.  Grandma&rsquo;s pizza, Grandpa&rsquo;s pizza, White pizza, mushroom pizza (which no one touched inexplicably) &ndash; the pizza game be diversified.  The day was one with a good flow &ndash; we first learned about the internets.  The internets is busy, and it keeps passing stuff back and forth like basketball drills to keep us seeing things and un-revolty.  The US government was down today (effing ridiculous), but hey, it&rsquo;s fine when you can watch people do things on Brobible.com (mind sanitize).</p>

<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/14570497">Packet Flight: RickRoll @ 12X</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/carlosb">Carlos Bueno</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>Then we moved on to designing this multi-room portal site pulling in Sinatra, Rails(Active Record), SQL, and HTML/CSS which was pretty cool, cause it lets people come onto your site, and then create a room and name things.  Of course, the first room I named was the toilet, because every good space including a wormhole, needs a toilet (keep it hyperspace-clean, son!).  My butt cheeks be allergic to anything that&rsquo;s not gold even when I&rsquo;m space-dimensional-contiuum-irrespective-morphing/traveling.</p>

<p><img src="http://maison.trouvetout.ca/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hong-kon-golden-toilet1.jpg" title="golden toilet" alt="golden toilet" /></p>

<p>I went back in time to fetch a 24k gold spouted butt-washer add-on with adjustable pressure/temperature controls.  Worth the risk of having to fight dinosaurs/aliens/zombies.</p>

			<![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s a bit of a toss, between life and the immersive.  No one said it would be easy.  No one said this.  And, certainly, no one promised that weekends would be rejuvenating.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s work was comprehendable enough.  We got to know the mystical black magic that is Active Record (AR) in Ruby on Rails.  It speaks a sort of yoda backwards SQL, and it does a bunch of weird things behind your back (well, not super weird, but certainly AR has a bit of the flair for the theatrical), oh, and did I mention, sir/madaam AR cares about your use of singles vs plural, even when it&rsquo;s only referencing your class objects as such for its own entertainment?  To not do so, would be uncivilized.</p>

<p>Oh, I&rsquo;m coming apart on a munday funday.  The week is a young-day.  Better keep strong.  Today, my pair-partner came down with a sickness, and now family-sized dispensers of Purell are on every desk in the house.  Keep the energy up, keep the health meters up, the mana and the mojo.  Rest, all you have to do is rest, and it&rsquo;ll be all right.</p>

<p>Arrays to strings to arrays to arrays to strings to goddamnit computer, why cant you just think the way I think, and we can be friends and share the same underpants?  You don&rsquo;t wear underpants.</p>

<p>5 years of life has come back to me, and now I&rsquo;m thinking of skipping off to enjoy a Saturday night instead of working all the way through.  I am not a computer &ndash; just yet.</p>
